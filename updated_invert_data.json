They are highly adaptable, capable of surviving low oxygen levels and polluted environments by waving their tails to absorb oxygen and encysting during droughts or food shortages. These worms play a role in nutrient cycling and are a potential vector for microplastic transfer in aquatic ecosystems. They are often used as live food in aquariums.",

They are known for their ability to survive in low-oxygen, polluted environments by waving their hemoglobin-rich tails to absorb oxygen. These worms feed on sediments, selectively digest bacteria, and can absorb molecules through their skin. They are resilient, capable of surviving drought and food shortages by forming protective cysts. Tubifex worms are often used as live food for aquarium fish but should be cleaned thoroughly to avoid introducing contaminants.",
