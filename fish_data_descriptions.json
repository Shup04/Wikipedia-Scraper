        "description": " The emerald catfish  (Corydoras splendens) is a tropical freshwater fish belonging to the Corydoradinae sub-family of the family Callichthyidae native to the Amazon Basin in South America.[1] It has traditionally been known as Brochis splendens.[2] The fish has appeared on a stamp in Brazil.[3] It was originally described as Callichthys splendens by Fran\u00e7ois Louis de la Porte, comte de Castelnau in 1855.  This species was once also commonly called Brochis coeruleus. W. A. Gosline was the first to suspect that the two species were the same in 1940, but it was actually Njiseen & Isbr\u00fccker, in 1970, who combined the two, giving sufficient reasons for doing so. The species would be described as Brochis splendens, until most of the catfish formerly classified as Brochis were re-classified into Corydoras.[2] The current recognized classification is thus Corydoras splendens.[1] It is native to the upper reaches Amazon Basin.[1] This includes Ucayali River to Pucallpa, Ambiyacu River, and the area around Iquitos in western Brazil, southeastern Colombia, eastern Ecuador and eastern Peru. Depending upon the angle of lighting, the fish's body reflects a metallic green, blue-green, or even a bluish color.  The ventral area is yellowish with the pectoral, ventral, and anal fins yellowish and the dorsal, caudal, and adipose fins a translucent brownish.  The females are larger and more robust than the males, and have a more pinkish belly as opposed to the more yellowish one for the males. This fish can be distinguished from the green/bronze corydoras catfish by its usually larger size, stouter body, and more pointed snout. The fish inhabits sluggish waters with dense vegetation along the banks.[1] It occurs in shallow muddy waters and will grow in length up to 7.5\u00a0centimetres (3\u00a0in).[1] It lives in a tropical climate in water with a 5.8\u20138.0 pH, a water hardness of 2\u201330 dGH, and a temperature range of 22\u201328\u00a0\u00b0C (72\u201382\u00a0\u00b0F).[1] It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, and insect larvae. It lays eggs in dense vegetation and adults do not guard the eggs. The emerald catfish is a common species in freshwater aquaria.  It is a peaceful, undemanding species and can be maintained under the same conditions as most Corydoras species.  They are shy and easily frightened when kept as individuals, so it is best kept in small groups of at least three, with more being recommended.  The tank should have only a soft, fine bottom to prevent damage to barbels and should be heavily planted.[4] Feeding is not difficult and they accept almost anything, although live worms are especially appreciated.[5] It does well in a community tank and does not tear up the plants.[5] Spawning has been achieved in captivity.[4] Typically, the fish are separated into a breeding tank in the ratio of three males to two females, all well-conditioned on live foods.  The couple will spawn while sitting on the bottom, not while swimming as many similar species do. In captivity, the female collects the eggs in her pelvic fin basket and pastes them individually to plants and other objects.  Eggs will be deposited by the female throughout the tank, but especially on any floating surface plants.  According to most reports, the parents do not immediately try to eat the eggs.  The eggs hatch in about four days and the fry become free swimming two days later."

It is native to South America, and is found in the western Amazon basin in Ecuador and Peru. This species is traditionally placed in Brochis but the genus is a synonym of Corydoras.[1][2] FishBase continues to recognize Brochis as a valid genus.[3] The fish has about 17 dorsal fin rays as compared with the 11 or 12 commonly seen in Corydoras splendens. The snout is considerably longer than other species in the genus which explains the common name. The fish will grow in length up to 6.7 centimetres (2.6 inches).[citation needed] The hog-nosed catfish lives in a tropical climate in water with a 6.0\u20137.2 pH, a water hardness of 15 dGH, and a temperature range of 21\u201324\u00a0\u00b0C (70\u201375\u00a0\u00b0F).

It originates in coastal drainages in South America from Rio de Janeiro to Santa Catarina, Brazil.[2] It was originally described as Callichthys barbatus by Jean Ren\u00e9 Constant Quoy & Joseph Paul Gaimard in 1824, from which it was transferred to genus Corydoras as Corydoras barbatus, a name which by which it is still being referred to in the aquarium industry. The species was further transferred to genus Scleromystax in 2003.[3] The fish will grow in length up to 9.8\u00a0centimetres (3.9\u00a0in).[2] This species has pronounced sexual dimorphism. The dorsal and pectoral fins of males reach, or almost reach, the caudal peduncle, and well-developed odontodes are inserted in fleshy tissue on a large area on the sides of the snout in fully grown males.[4] The banded corydoras lives in a subtropical climate in water with a 6.0\u20138.0 pH, a water hardness of 2\u201325 dGH, and a temperature of 68\u00a0\u00b0F (20\u00a0\u00b0C) to 82\u00a0\u00b0F (28\u00a0\u00b0C).[2] It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. It lays eggs in dense vegetation and adults do not guard the eggs. In captivity, as the sperm are released the female sinks to the bottom, resting on one of her pectoral fins while she starts fanning with the other pectoral fin. At this time, some eggs are released which fall into the pelvic fin basket and are apparently fertilized at that time. The banded corydoras is of commercial importance in the aquarium trade industry. Though peaceful, they get larger than most Corydoras and are therefore less suitable for small aquaria.[5]  This Callichthyidae-related article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it."

        "description": " The bronze corydoras  (Corydoras aeneus), also known as the green corydoras, bronze catfish, lightspot corydoras or wavy catfish, is a species of freshwater fish in the armored catfish family, Callichthyidae, often kept as an aquarium fish. It is widely distributed in South America on the eastern side of the Andes, from Colombia and Trinidad to the R\u00edo de la Plata basin;[2] however, as presently defined it is a species complex and a taxonomic review is necessary.[3] It was originally described as Hoplosoma aeneum (based on a specimen from Trinidad) by Theodore Gill in 1858 and has historically also been referred to as Callichthys aeneus.[2] The adult size is 6\u00bd cm for males and a slightly larger 7\u00a0cm for females (2\u00bd to 2\u00be inches).[4]   Females have a slightly higher body frame than males in accordance with their larger abdominal region. Their average life span is 10 years. It has a yellow or pink body, white belly, and is blue-grey over its head and back. Its fins are yellow or pink and immaculate. In common with most Corydoras the dorsal, pectoral and adipose fins have an additional sharp barb and have a mild poison which causes fish which try to attack them to get stung. A brownish-orange patch is usually present on the head, just before the dorsal fin, and is its most distinctive feature when viewed from above in the stream. Their upper sides are often a greenish color, which is the reason another common name for this fish is the green corydoras. Like many other catfishes, females are larger than males in this species.[5] They are found in quiet, shallow waters with soft bottoms that can sometimes be heavily polluted by clouds of disturbed mud from the bottom, but it also inhabits running waters.[2] In its native habitat, it inhabits waters with a temperature range of 25\u00a0\u00b0C to 28\u00a0\u00b0C (77\u00a0\u00b0F to 82\u00a0\u00b0F), pH 6.0\u20138.0, and hardness 5 to 19 DGH.[2] Like most members of the genus Corydoras, these catfish have a unique method of coping with the low oxygen content that prevails in such environments. In addition to utilizing their gills like any other fish, they rapidly come to the surface of the water and draw air in through their mouth. This air is then absorbed through the wall of the intestine and any surplus air is expelled through the vent.[2] It typically stays in schools of 20 to 30 individuals.[2] It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter.[2] Reproduction occurs with the onset of the rainy season, which changes the water chemistry.[2] Females spawn 10\u201320 egg-clutches with multiple males at a time, but an entire egg clutch is inseminated by the sperm of a single male.[5] In laboratory observations, it was found that bronze corydoras have a unique method of insemination. When these fish reproduce, the male will present his abdomen to the female. The female will attach her mouth to the male's genital opening, creating the well-known \"T-position\" many Corydoras exhibit during courtship. The female will then drink the sperm. The sperm rapidly moves through her intestines and is discharged together with her eggs into a pouch formed by her pelvic fins. The female can then swim away and deposit the pouch somewhere else alone. Because the T-position is exhibited in other species than just C. aeneus, it is likely that they also exhibit this behavior.[6] In the wild, eggs are laid on waterweeds.[5] Males do not form territories or compete over females; interference between males might only happen when two males present their abdomens simultaneously. On the other hand, females do not choose between males. Mating is more or less random; therefore, male reproductive success is directly related to courtship frequency.[5] The eggs of C. aeneus exhibit a unique surface pattern with small villi-like protuberances which resemble attaching-filaments of teleost eggs. These structures allow the eggs to be adhesive and stick to a specific place or to each other. The presence of these structures may be related to the turbid habitat in which this species lives.[7] Bronze corydoras are probably the most popular Corydoras species.[8] It is annually bred and shipped in large quantities all over the world[9] It is easily bred and is produced in commercial quantities in the United States, Europe, and Singapore. Most of the available fish are therefore domestic strains. Wild imports are reported to be less easy to breed.[citation needed] They are a hardy and useful aquarium fish despite having a coloration that is by no means striking or unusual. Many aquarists are fascinated by the habits of these fish. They ceaselessly comb the bottom of the aquarium for food and therefore disturb it slightly, sending up detritus and waste material that has settled loosely on the bottom. They prefer being kept in groups of 5 or more, being sociable fish and are ideal fish for a community tank.[2] Other Corydoras species can be placed in the same aquarium, and despite the strong resemblance many species bear to one another, the species will tend to separate out and only move about among their own kind. Corydoras aeneus is not particular about the composition of the water. Adequate conditions are a temperature range of 20 to 28\u00a0\u00b0C (68 to 82\u00a0\u00b0F), pH of 6.0\u20138.0, and hardness of 2\u201330 DGH. The water should have no salt added to it.[8] A fairly dense growth of plants with a number of possible hiding places is greatly appreciated. Corys are easy to feed, they are omnivores eating all flake and pelleted food and also live and frozen foods. When it comes to sperm, then the female glues the eggs, only a few in number, to the chosen substrate and then (sometimes) quickly touches them with her mouth. After several acts of spawning, which span a total of two to three hours, one female will have produced up to 200 eggs. Frequently, two males are used for each female, as one male has difficulty fertilizing all the eggs. The eggs gradually grow darker in color, and just prior to hatching (ranging from three days at 28\u00a0\u00b0C to a week at 20\u00a0\u00b0C) they turn dark brown. The fry keep to the bottom of the tank, feeding on detritus and any fine foods available. The parents may spawn again within two to three weeks. The albino corydoras is an albino variety of the bronze corydoras that has been developed for the aquarium trade, with a pale pink or orange body and red eyes.  It is physically similar to normally-colored individuals, although some breeders report that the fry are a little slower to develop.[10] Others say that the albinos are practically blind and that the males are somewhat sterile, although this may be due to extensive inbreeding.[11] Albino bronze corydoras are frequently injected with bright dye (via a needle) and sold in aquariums. This controversial practice is known as \"painting\" or \"juicing\" fish."

        "description": " The dwarf corydoras (Corydoras hastatus), dwarf catfish, tail spot pygmy catfish, or micro catfish is a tropical freshwater fish belonging to the subfamily Corydoradinae of the family Callichthyidae.  It originates in inland waters in South America, and is found in the Amazon River and Paraguay River basins in Argentina, Bolivia, and Brazil.[1] The specific epithet hastatus means with a spear, in reference to the spearhead-like spot on the tail root. The body of Corydoras hastatus is typically more elongated than other Corydoras species.  Its body is a translucent white to olive color, with a thin dark stripe on the sides from behind the gill cover to the root of the tail, and a whitish belly.  It has a white crescent at the base of the tail surrounding a black spot.  The fish will grow in length up to 1.4 inches (3.5\u00a0cm), but 1.0 inch (2.5\u00a0cm) is more typical.  Males are smaller, more slender and have a more pointed dorsal fin than females. The dwarf corydoras lives in a (sub)tropical climate in water with a 6.0\u20138.0 pH, a water hardness of 5\u201319 dGH, and a temperature range of 68\u201382 F (20\u201328\u00a0\u00b0C).[1] It is found in ponds.[1] It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. They are found in the Paraguay River and Amazon River basins. C. hastatus lives among plants.[1] It is a schooling species.[1] It differs from most Corydoras species by preferring the midwater areas instead of the bottom, spending most of its time well off the bottom in areas of dense plants.  When it rests, it rests on the leaves of the plants.  Other Corydoras species with similar mid-water habits include C. habrosus and C. pygmaeus. The dwarf Corydoras maintains its position in a current by using rapid fin movements, especially with its pectoral fins. These rapid movements, combined with a high breathing rate, give the fish the appearance of being very \"nervous\" when compared with other fish. C. hastatus may even shoal with small characins. The fish lays its eggs in dense vegetation and the adults do not guard the eggs.  The female holds a single egg between her pelvic fins, where the male fertilizes them for about 30 seconds.  Only then does the female swim to a suitable spot, where she attaches the sticky egg. The pair repeats this process about every three minutes for from one to two hours with some 10- to 15-minute rests between egg releases.  Around 7 to 15 eggs are spawned in a single day, and spawning occurs on three to four consecutive days. A total of 30 to 60 eggs may be spawned by a single female over this period of time. The eggs hatch in three to nine days.  The fry are about 6\u00a0mm long at hatching, mostly translucent but sometimes with spots. In two months, the fry average about 18\u00a0mm in length.  The fry mature in six to eight months. The dwarf corydoras is of commercial importance in the aquarium trade industry.   Due to its small size, this fish can be kept in a relatively small aquarium; a 5-gallon (20 litre) tank is sufficient for a small school.  Since it is a schooling fish, it should only be kept in groups of at least six individuals.  It is a good community tank fish when kept with peaceful tankmates such as tetras, rasboras, and danios, but should not be kept with overly aggressive tankmates.  They have also been used as scavengers for fry tanks. The aquarium should be clean, well-aerated, and densely planted to provide hiding places.  A moderate current provided by a power filter or canister filter is appreciated.  The water should be slightly alkaline (pH about 7.6) within a temperature range of 24\u00b0 to 29\u00a0\u00b0C.  Although the fish is generally a mid-water dweller, a fine gravel or sand substrate should be provided since it will occasionally burrow. The fish will feed both in midwater or on a substrate, whether that substrate is a plant leaf, a broad rock, or the bottom of the tank.  It accepts most foods, including freeze-dried, flake, and frozen foods, although live foods are particularly appreciated. The methods of spawning this fish in the aquarium is similar to spawning most other Corydoras species.  The spawning tank can be as small as 2.5 gallons (10 L), but at least a 5-gallon (20 L) tank is recommended with aged water, a sponge filter and some plants.  Fish should be conditioned with large amounts of live foods such as Tubifex and whiteworms, during which time the females will become noticeably plumper.  Since C. hastatus may spawn as a school, the whole group can be conditioned for spawning at the same time, and for best results, there should be at least two males for every female. Spawning of well-conditioned fish may be initiated by the addition of cooler water.  During spawning, very little food is accepted, but the fish will immediately search for food after finishing.  It will typically attach its eggs to the plants in the aquarium, but if not enough plants are available, the sides of the aquarium may be used.  When the fry hatch, they can be fed newly hatched brine shrimp or microworms.  The parents may be ready to spawn again in a couple of weeks."

The fish's appearance is characterized by dark double longitudinal stripes. The dorsal fin is ornamented by a few gray dots, taking on an arching pattern in some individuals. The body has other gray and black markings on an olive background. Compared with other species of Corydoras, the body is not as tall in comparison to its length, and its eyes are set a bit lower. The fish will grow in length up to 5.1 centimetres (2.0 inches). It lives in a tropical climate in water with a 6.0 - 8.0 pH, a water hardness of 2 \u2013 25 dGH, and a temperature range of 22\u201326\u00a0\u00b0C (72\u201379\u00a0\u00b0F). It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. Though it lays eggs in dense vegetation, adults do not guard them. In captivity, the male is reportedly territorial during the prespawning activities while the female is usually hidden among the plant roots. Both sexes clean the underside of plant leaves. Eggs are fastened under the leaves and are also attached to roots of plants. The elegant corydoras is of commercial importance in the aquarium trade industry. It tends to swim in the upper levels of the aquarium, instead of at the bottom as is common with most species of Corydoras, and does not seem to disturb the sediment as much."

        "description": " Corydoras panda is a species of catfish belonging to the genus Corydoras, of the family Callichthyidae, and is a native member of the riverine fauna of South America.  It is found in Peru and Ecuador, most notably in the Hu\u00e1nuco region, where it inhabits the R\u00edo Aquas, the R\u00edo Amarillae, a tributary of the R\u00edo Pachitea, and the R\u00edo Ucayali river system. The species was first collected by Randolph H. Richards in 1968, and was named Corydoras panda by Nijssen and Isbr\u00fccker in 1971. The specific name is an allusion to the appearance of the fish, which possesses large black patches surrounding the eyes, reminiscent of those found on the giant panda. Accordingly, the common names for this fish, which is a popular aquarium species, are panda corydoras and panda catfish. Corydoras panda has an off-white to pinkish-orange ground colour, and when observed under certain lighting conditions, a faint greenish iridescence is present upon the flanks and the operculum. The fins of the fish match the body in ground colour, upon close inspection being seen to be hyaline or translucent with coloured fin rays, with the dorsal fin being marked by a conspicuous black blotch that covers almost the entire fin area. The caudal peduncle is marked with a black band, this black band encircling the caudal peduncle from dorsal to ventral surface. The adipose fin, supported by a small fin spine, sometimes contains black pigmentation. The head is the same ground colour as the body, with a black mask surrounding the eyes, descending vertically from the fontanel, over each eye, and ending in a triangular wedge immediately before the ventral surface of the head. The pectoral fins are positioned immediately behind the operculum, and are usually oriented horizontally when the fish is at rest, extended in a manner similar to the wings of an aeroplane. The pelvic fins are positioned upon the ventral surface of the fish, located some way behind the pectoral fins. The first ray of the dorsal fin emanates from the body at approximately its point of greatest elevation, and a vertical line drawn downwards from this point meets the attachment point of the pelvic fins. The anal fin is located far to the rear of the ventral surface of the body, the attachment point of the first fin ray being somewhat forward of the black caudal peduncle marking described above. In common with all other members of the family Callichthyidae, the body surface is covered, not with scales, but with bony plates known as scutes. The lines of demarcation between individual scutes can be seen upon close examination of this and almost all other Callichthyid fishes, and in the case of some specimens of this species, are highlighted by additional black pigment. The fish possesses, in common with almost all Corydoras species, three pairs of barbels\u2014one pair of maxillary barbels and two pairs of rictal barbels. A fully mature adult specimen of this species attains a standard length of 55 millimetres (2.1\u00a0inches): this is the length attained by mature females, which grow larger than mature males, and also possess more rounded body outlines. Corydoras panda inhabits clear river waters that are relatively fast-flowing, well-oxygenated, and flowing over substrates that may comprise soft sand or fine gravel. These rivers are usually well vegetated with assorted species of aquatic plants. The proximity of the home rivers of the fish to the Andes mountain range, and the replenishment of those rivers with meltwaters from Andean snows at higher altitudes, has led the fish to be adaptable to cooler temperatures than the norm for 'tropical' fishes\u2014the temperature range of the fish is 16\u00a0\u00b0C to 28\u00a0\u00b0C, though the fish exhibits a marked preference for the cooler regions of this temperature spectrum, particularly in captivity. Indeed, the fish can, for small time-periods, survive temperatures as low as 12\u00a0\u00b0C, though captive rearing at such low temperatures is ill-advised. The native waters of Corydoras panda are consequently mineral-deficient, with a neutral to slightly acid pH, and replication of such conditions in captivity are recommended for successful maintenance. Corydoras panda has a preference for cooler than normal waters when compared to many other popular tropical fish species. Because of this, those who keep C. panda in community aquarium setting must choose tankmates that share its preference for cooler temperatures of around 20\u00a0\u00b0C (68\u00a0\u00b0F) to 25\u00a0\u00b0C (77\u00a0\u00b0F).[2] Given the cleanliness of the fish's native waters, scrupulous attention to water quality in the aquarium is considerably more important for this fish than for the more domesticated Corydoras species such as C. paleatus or C. aeneus. Additionally, scrupulous attention to aquarium substrate cleanliness is a must, as the fish are intolerant of poor aquarium maintenance in this area, and succumb to stress and disease rapidly if their aquaria are not kept to a high standard. Despite this, the species remains highly popular with aquarists, upon account of the appearance of the fish, and its lively, vivacious behaviour in a well-planned aquarium setting. Like many other Corydoras species, the panda catfish is a highly gregarious fish, and in common with several other smaller Corydoras species such as C. habrosus and C. pygmaeus, manifests a distinct need for numerous companions of its own species in order to thrive, and can thus be described as being more avowedly social than some of the larger members of the genus. A minimum of eight individuals should be housed in the same aquarium, and if space permits, this number should be revised upwards, as the fish exhibits a very definite preference for grouping together with others of its species. They also associate themselves easily with the clown loach and school together in currents where sufficient numbers of their own species is lacking. An aquarium for this species should be well furnished, ideally with a mixture of live aquatic plants, and solid furnishings providing caves, sheltered areas and hiding places to give the fish security. Floating plants to provide additional areas of shade are also welcomed by the fish. Like all Corydoras species, the fish feeds primarily upon animal matter. The aquarist is advised, however, that the traditional use of Corydoras catfishes as putative 'scavengers' in an aquarium setting will be detrimental to the well-being of this species\u2014it requires high quality foods for long-term maintenance, and a varied diet. Ideally, the fish should be given live foods at least intermittently, and will dine enthusiastically upon such items as Bloodworms (larvae of Chironomus midges), Daphnia, cultivated Brine Shrimp (Atermia salina), and Tubifex worms. The last, however, should be cultivated in order to minimise the risk of introducing pathogenic organisms to the aquarium, as Tubifex live in unsanitary conditions in the wild. Freeze dried Tubifex may be preferable, as the risk of introduction of disease is eliminated. High quality flake foods are also appreciated, particularly those containing shrimp or other similar matter. The lifespan of Corydoras panda in the aquarium has not been systematically determined, but given the longevity of other Corydoras species in the aquarium, it is reasonable to assume that well-cared for specimens will enjoy a lifespan in excess of ten years, and frequently in excess of 15 years. Corydoras panda follows, with a few minor deviations, the standard model for breeding for the genus. Stimulus for breeding consists of the influx of cooler, oxygenated waters into their habitat, usually corresponding in the wild with the onset of the rainy season. However, while some Corydoras species require a temperature drop in the aquarium for spawning to be stimulated, in the case of Corydoras panda, the temperature drop appears to matter much less, as specimens have spawned in the aquarium without a temperature drop. The addition of new, clean, oxygenated water appears to be the primary stimulus for this species. In the wild, the appearance of new water courtesy of the rains is followed by an increase in the populations of assorted food organisms, and feeding upon these conditions the fishes for breeding. Once conditioned fish are stimulated into spawning, males begin chasing females energetically. Females begin developing eggs within their reproductive tracts, and when 'ripe' (laden with eggs), become receptive to the attentions of the males. Eventually, one male will succeed in courting a female, using his barbels to provide stimulation to the female, usually beginning with caresses of the female's caudal peduncle, followed by caresses of the fontanel and the front of the head. if the female is receptive, then the male positions himself before the female, so that the female's mouth is in close proximity with one of the male's pectoral fins. The male then clasps the female's barbels between the pectoral fin and the body, and this stimulates the female to press against the male's side. When seen from above, the fish form a 'T' shape when conjoined thus, hence the term 'T position' has become conventional in aquarium circles when describing the breeding of Corydoras catfishes. Once the male and female are in the 'T position', the pressing of the female against the male's body stimulates his release of sperm. Though the exact mechanism of fertilisation has yet to be scientifically documented, from the observations of aquarists who have been successful in breeding Corydoras catfishes, it seems likely that the female takes the male's sperm through her mouthparts, and directs them through the gills, in a current that carries the sperm to her pelvic fins. At this point, the female releases a single egg (occasionally two), and purses her pelvic fins in order to provide a receptacle for the freshly extruded egg, which is then fertilised. One difference observed between the adoption of the 'T position' in Corydoras panda, when compared to other Corydoras species, is that the exercise is frequently more acrobatic in appearance, with the 'T position' being adopted in mid-water, some distance above the substrate, rather than resting upon the substrate as is the case with the majority of other Corydoras. Once the female is carrying a fertilised egg within her pelvic fins, she then seeks an egg deposition site. The choice of such a site is frequently, though not always, a mass of fine leaved aquatic vegetation. In the aquarium, the plant known as Java moss, Vesicularia dubayana, is of considerable utility as an egg repository for Corydoras catfishes, even though the plant is not a South American native, and panda catfish females will choose large clumps of this plant readily as safe deposition sites for fertilised eggs. The female is frequently pursued by one or more males as she seeks the deposition site, each male presumably seeking to be the chosen mate to fertilise the next egg. Up to 25 eggs may be produced by a single female during a single spawning, which may take place over four to five hours. Fertile Corydoras panda eggs require approximately 3\u20134 days development time before hatching, if kept at a temperature of 22\u00a0\u00b0C. This development time will vary with temperature, taking longer in cooler water. Upon hatching, the fry are four millimetres long, translucent, but already possessing the basic ground colour of the species, and upon close examination, possess fully formed barbels. Even newly hatched fry possess at least some hint of the adult eye patches, and as the fry grow, these patches darken and become more prominent. Even so, at just four millimetres in length, the fry are practically invisible against typical aquarium gravel unless seen to move. The fry take approximately four weeks to develop to the point where the finfold, a continuous undifferentiated membrane resembling that seen at the posterior of a tadpole, has differentiated into the unpaired fins (dorsal, anal and caudal fins). During this time, size will have increased to approximately eight or nine millimetres, and the fish will begin to develop colour changes leading to that of the adult fish. From this point, the caudal peduncle patch and dorsal fin patch will begin to appear, but the body will also be seen to be covered in fine black 'pepper dots' between these black patches. Only after a period of 10 to 12 weeks, at which point the fish has assumed a size of 12 to 14 millimetres, will the fish attain the colouration of the adult, and be in all respects a perfect miniature of the parents. Fry of this species are particularly sensitive to changes in water chemistry and to elevated temperatures. While adult fishes can withstand temperatures of 28\u00a0\u00b0C, fry will die of heat stress if exposed to temperatures above 26\u00a0\u00b0C, and their chances of survival are enhanced if the water temperature is kept at 22\u00a0\u00b0C or below. Water changes made to a nursery aquarium during the first 21 days of life of the fry\u2014the critical period during which they manifest the greatest sensitivity to their environment\u2014must be gradual, and the incoming water conditioned to match that of the existing aquarium water where possible before the water change takes place. While the fry are likely to develop best if given infusoria as part of their feeding r\u00e9gime, it is possible to raise fry to adulthood entirely upon prepared foods."

        "description": " Corydoras paleatus is a species of catfish (order Siluriformes) of the family Callichthyidae. Its common names include blue leopard corydoras, mottled corydoras, and peppered catfish.[1] It originates from the lower Paran\u00e1 River basin and coastal rivers in Uruguay and Brazil.[1] This fish species reach about 5.9 - 7 centimeters (2.3 - 2.75 \u00a0in) SL.[1] The male is smaller than the female, and in proportion to body length, the dorsal fin and pectoral fins are longer on the male than the female.[2] Corydoras paleatus is found in the Amazon basin,[1] and feeds on worms, crustaceans, insects, and plant matter.[1] C. paleatus has been known to produce sound; it does this by the abduction of its pectoral fins. This is used by males during courtship and intrapersonal communication, and by both sexes and juveniles when distressed.[2] In reproduction, males do not behave aggressively toward each other, nor do they monopolize mating areas or females.[2] The T-position is involved in courtship, as with many other Corydoras species.[2] Charles Darwin discovered the C. paleatus when he went to Buenos Aires during his expedition aboard the Beagle during the 1830s.[3] It is a very good choice for the community aquarium, as it is a hardy,[4] good-looking, and peaceful fish.[4] They can be successfully kept with other small, peaceful aquarium fish like livebearers, danios, and tetras. It is sometimes seen in the shops as an albino form, although this is similar to other albino corys (see the C. aeneus albino form). It grows to around 7.5\u00a0cm and is easily bred at home. These fish prefer a planted tank with temperatures around 16 to 24 \u00b0C (61 \u2013 75 \u00b0F), although they can take lower temperatures than this as it originates from colder waters.[3] Their high temperature tolerance seems poor, and 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F) is the highest safe temperature. They like to nibble on the algae that grow on floating plants but are not specialized algae-eating catfish. The lighting must not be too bright, and hiding places, such as bogwood, are needed as they like to hide from the light during certain parts of the day. Heavily planted areas should also be provided, where the light is minimized, as they like darker areas due to their bottom-feeding nature. Diet should be sinking pellets, algae wafers, frozen and live food, such as bloodworm or daphnia. They may also occasionally enjoy blanched spinach, which can be attached to plants with a peg or the side of the glass with magnetic clips. They can be seen to dart to the top of the tank: this is because they can use atmospheric oxygen to supplement what their gills extract from the water.[5] They will do this more frequently  when water quality is starting to deteriorate, and so should be watched for this indication. Peppered corydoras reach their sexual maturity and start to show reproductive behaviors once the females reach an average (minimum) size of 5.625 cm (2.214 inches) and once the males reach about 4.875 cm (1.919 inches).[citation needed] The males initiate the courtship ritual, which entails chasing the females around the tank. The female darts away, and the males search for her and find her a few moments later. The males shiver all over the female and may lie down on top of her. When she is ready to spawn, she turns to the male next to her and pounds below his ventral fin. The pair go into the \"T-position\" with the male releasing the sperm into the female's mouth before the sperm fertilizes the eggs[citation needed]. The female cups her ventral fins and lays a few eggs (usually between 4 and 12 eggs[citation needed]) in her fins.  The eggs are about 1.8 mm in diameter[citation needed]. The female now starts cleaning a spot on the glass to put her eggs on. Corydoras are egg depositors and lay their eggs all over the aquarium. Favorite spots include the heater, filters, and the glass, although, occasionally eggs are also laid on plants and driftwood. After depositing a group of eggs closely together, the female rests for a few moments. The males regroup and start chasing each other and then resume chasing the female. The males are so relentless in this pursuit that they try to mate with the female even while she is busy laying her eggs. The spawning lasts more than an hour, and many eggs are laid in different places. On average, about 50 to 150 eggs are laid during a single spawning[citation needed]. The incubation period for the eggs for peppered corydoras was found to be between 96 hours and 113 hours at 24\u00b12\u00b0C, with the average incubation period being about 102 hours (or 4.25 days)[citation needed]. In one study, the average hatching ratio of the eggs was found to be approximately 87%, with the overall egg-laying period lasting between 20 and 35 days[citation needed]. Peppered cories can eat their eggs, but will not eat the living fry.  At first, the fry is small (with a mean length of 7.5246 mm[citation needed]) and is unable to eat, sustaining themselves on the last of their yolk sacs. The fry will begin to eat 1\u20133 days after hatching, and will eat the protozoan organisms in the tank and can be fed powdered food at this stage.  By about one month, the fry will start to become rounder and will begin developing adult coloration, eventually becoming miniature versions of the adults[citation needed]. The juveniles will reach adult size at around 1 year of age, although this varies between individuals and how well they are kept. The age of sexual maturity also varies between individuals, but juveniles will typically begin breeding at around 8\u201312 months of age. However, they can begin as early as 6 months and as late as 18 months of age. From the onset of sexual maturity, it can take the fish up to another year to successfully produce fertile eggs; at first, entire clutches of eggs may be infertile. Albino strains may develop slower and be less fertile due to inbreeding. Media related to Corydoras paleatus at Wikimedia Commons"

The first scientific description of the pygmy corydoras was published in 1966 by German biologist and physician Joachim Knaack, in Aquarien und Terrarien-Zeitschrift.[2][3] One specimen was designated the holotype and one additional specimen was collected as a paratype.[2] The scientific name uses the Latin word pygmaeus, meaning dwarf or pygmy.[4] A species of Corydoras with a similar appearance, Corydoras hastatus was described in the 1880s, and many specimens that were described as Corydoras hastatus between the 1920s and 1950s were subsequently found to be misidentified specimens of the pygmy corydoras.[1] In older literature, the pygmy corydoras is frequently mislabeled due to Corydoras hastatus being the only miniature Corydoras species known at the time.[1] The pygmy corydoras is a silver-colored fish, with an unbroken black line that runs horizontally along the center of the sides of the fish from the tip of its snout to its caudal peduncle.[5] It has a second thin black line along the lower part of the side of the body, from behind the ventral fins and continuing into the tail.[5] The top part of the body has a light black or dark gray shading that starts on the top of its snout and ends at the tail.[5] Newly hatched fry have vertical stripes along the sides of their bodies that fade by the end of their first month, when the horizontal stripes of the adult fish begin to appear.[5] The maximum length of the species is about 3.2 centimeters (1.3\u00a0in),[6] but typical adult sizes are 1.9 centimeters (0.75\u00a0in) for males and 2.5 centimeters (1.0\u00a0in) for females.[1] In addition to their larger length, females are also rounder and broader than males, especially when they have eggs.[7] Young fry grow rapidly after hatching, reaching 13 millimeters (0.51\u00a0in) in six to eight weeks.[1] The pygmy corydoras is widely distributed in inland waters in Peru in tributaries of the Nanay River, in Ecuador in tributaries of the Aguarico River, and in western Brazil in tributaries of the Madeira River.[8] The holotype was obtained from Calama, Brazil, along the Madeira River near the mouth of the Ji-Paran\u00e1 River.[6] The pygmy corydoras lives in a tropical climate in water with a 6.0 - 8.0 pH,[9] a water hardness of 2 \u2013 25 dGH,[9] and a temperature range of 22\u201326\u00a0\u00b0C (72\u201379\u00a0\u00b0F).[9] It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. The pygmy corydoras lays approximately 100 eggs at a time.[9] The female holds 2\u20134 eggs at a time in a pouch formed by her pelvic fins while they are fertilized by the male, which takes about 30 seconds.[9] The female swims to a safe location with the fertilized eggs, where she attaches the sticky eggs to a surface, where they will remain.[9] It is a peaceful fish, shoaling fish and can be kept in a community aquarium of smaller fish species such as ember tetras. It can be fed most sinking foods, flakes, frozen food and sinking wafers. It can be kept with small shrimp and snails. In aquariums, they are often kept on fine grained substrate, such as sand. This enables them to dig through the substrate without injury to their barbels, which can often be lost in sharp substrates. They are often kept at a pH of between 6.5 and 7.0. They are schooling fish that are usually kept in groups of at least four and will also behave much more naturally in larger groups (10 or more). Unlike the larger more common Corydoras, they often swim in shoals around the mid water and lower regions of the tank. C. pygmaeus are peaceful fish which will not thrive with aggressive tankmates. They are perhaps best kept in a planted species tank, or with shrimp such as Neocaridina spp. They seem to do best when offered live foods in addition to prepared food items. Appropriate foods include microworms or similar nematodes, as well as Artemia nauplii (newly hatched brine shrimp)."

It originates in inland waters in South America, and is found in the Upper Orinoco River basin in Venezuela and Colombia. C. habrosus, is often found in periodic wetlands, large floodplains to where other species migrate seasonally. These small corydoras are prone to entrapment in receding waters, and populations can suffer during the dry season.[2] Their natural habitat tends to be abundant in leaf litter and plant life, providing ample cover to allow these fish to roam moderately freely. As a bottom dwelling species C. habrosus tends to stick to the lower regions of the river, however, on occasion corydoras will dart up to the water surface to take in air. They use their intestines as an air breathing organ to absorb oxygen, and expel the remnant air out of the anus.[3] The fish will grow in length up to 1.4 inches (3.5 centimeters). It lives in a tropical climate in water with a 5.5 \u2013 7.5 pH, a water hardness of 2 \u2013 10 dGH, and a temperature of about 77\u00a0\u00b0F (25\u00a0\u00b0C).[4] The diet consists of worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. It is a peaceful fish and can be kept in a community aquarium of smaller fish species such as ember tetras, clown panchax, endler guppies and small species of rasbora.  It should be kept in groups of at least 6 individuals, ideally 10 or more. A shoal should be kept in a tank that is at least 14 gallons in size.[5] Salt and pepper catfish can be fed most small sinking foods including pellets, flake food and preserved baby brine shrimp. Frozen foods such as baby brine shrimp, rotifers and cyclops can also be fed either regularly or exclusively. In captivity, breeding can be difficult to achieve. Some aquarists report that large water changes with relatively cold water can stimulate habrosus in to spawning.[6] Spawning is marked by obvious behaviours; males will swim close to the female, if multiple males are present they will surround the female swimming from side to side quickly. The female holds an egg visibly under her ventral fin ready for fertilising. The female can then be seen to 'massage' the males belly. The female will then choose an appropriate place to deposit her egg, usually on plants near the substrate, particularly on the underside of the leaves but can also be found on the aquarium glass and decor.  Eggs are rarely placed on the top of the leaves or close to the water surface. The spawning male will protect the female from other males attempting to spawn with her.

        "description": " Sterba's corydoras (Corydoras sterbai) is a member of the South American Corydoras genus of freshwater aquarium catfish and one of the most popular species of Corydoras due to its attractive markings. The fish is native to the Guapor\u00e9 River region between Bolivia and Brazil.[1] Sterba's cory is distinguishable from other Corydoras species as it has white spots on a black background on its head. It is occasionally confused with Corydoras haraldschultzi; the difference is that the latter has a pattern of black dots on a white background on the head.  C. sterbai has recently become available in an albino form and a black form. Like many Corydoras species, Sterba's corydoras is a shoaling catfish, and thus should ideally be kept in groups of 5 or more. In the wild it can be found in Brazil and thus, wild caught fish prefer soft, acidic water. However, Sterba's corydoras is a hardy fish and tank bred specimens have adapted to a wider range of water conditions. However, like almost all fish it will not tolerate high levels of nitrates. Unlike some other catfish they are not good algae eaters, but are good at \"cleaning up\" leftover food and detritus from the substrate. Corydoras sterbai are relatively small for catfish, growing to a maximum size of only 2\u20132.6 inches (5.1\u20136.6\u00a0cm). In captivity Corydoras sterbai readily accepts a wide variety of prepared and frozen foods. Flake food is a good staple diet (which will only be consumed once it has fallen to the bottom) as are sinking pellets or wafers. They relish live and frozen foods such as bloodworm, daphnia and mosquito larvae, but ideally should only be fed such foods once a week due to the high amount of protein in them. It is often problematic to feed Corydoras in aquaria with fast feeding mid-water fish such as tetras as flake and sinking pellets are consumed by such fish before they have hit the bottom and sometimes, even while lying on the substrate. However, this problem can be overcome by placing pellets and flake on the aquarium substrate in caves or under bogwood, or other such areas which are not regularly frequented by mid-water fish. The compatibility of C. sterbai is one of their main selling points as with all other Corydoras species as they are very peaceful catfish and can be kept with other peaceful fish. They should not be kept with overly aggressive bottom dwellers, particularly if there is competition over substrate space as there would be in small tanks or tanks with a large amount of \"furniture\". Ideal companions would be similar sized tetras or particularly, dwarf cichlids. Ideally Corydoras sterbai should be housed with a fine substrate such as sand or gravel in order to avoid doing damage to their delicate barbels. However, large gravel will suffice as long as it is not sharp edged. Their only other requirement is that shade be provided for them, by means of overhanging rock, large leaved plants, arching bogwood or caves. Breeding is not too difficult. A tank with dimensions 18\u2033 x 12\u2033 x 12\u2033 (10 US Gallon) is recommended. The breeding ratio that should be kept is 2 males per female. Good diet together with repeated water changes and drops of temperature are usually sufficient. However, raising the fry is not easy due to its high sensitivity. Occasionally problems can arise while transporting these fish as they are capable of secreting a chemical toxin when stressed or overcrowded. For this reason they are never shipped with other fish. The species name of this Corydoras is in honour of Professor Dr. G\u00fcnther Sterba, professor emeritus of zoology of Leipzig University, member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.[2] Professor Sterba is a professional ichthyologist who nevertheless produced several very popular books regarded as virtual bibles for fishkeepers over the 1970s and 1980s, translated into English under the titles Freshwater Fishes of the World, Aquarium Care and (with Dick Mills) The Aquarists' Encyclopedia, despite his degree of isolation at that time by virtue of living in the then German Democratic Republic."

        "description": " Corydoras julii (also known as the julii cory or leopard catfish[2]) is a small freshwater catfish native to eastern Brazil. It is often confused with Corydoras trilineatus,[3] the three stripe corydoras. Corydoras julii are small, peaceful shoaling fish, and are typically kept in groups in captivity.[4] Corydoras julii is a relatively small species of fish, growing to be no more than 52 millimeters in length.[5] Its skin is a translucent whitish-gray, with fine black spotting across the body and a horizontal stripe which reaches up the mid-body until it is equal with the front base of the dorsal fin. This spotting pattern is the primary visual difference between C. julii and three stripe corydoras (C. trilineatus), which have larger reticulations, as opposed to spots, and a longer mid-body stripe. C. julii might be further distinguished from C. trilineatus by the spotted pattern on its head; however, C. trilineatus can also show this pattern on occasion.[5] Females are typically larger and rounder than males.[6] Corydoras julii, like almost all Corydoras species, are bottom-feeding scavengers. Their diet consists primarily of small invertebrates which they sift from the substrate, expelling the particles of sand and sediment through their gill openings. In captivity, their diet is frequently sinking pellets rich in insect and other invertebrate proteins, as well as live or frozen invertebrates like bloodworms, daphnia, brine shrimp, and California blackworms (Lumbriculus variegatus).[4] After sexual maturity, Corydoras spawning appears to be triggered by storms.[6] During this storm, the fish eat increased amounts of insects. The water gradually decreases temperature over the course of a few days.[6] Corydoras fish breed in a position resembling a \"T formation\". In this formation, the female swims up to the male's abdomen, and consumes sperm released by the male. The sperm rapidly travels though the female's intestinal tract and fertilizes the eggs in the cloaca. Small, white, sturdy eggs are laid on plant leaves in the wild. Adult corydoras have been known to eat their own eggs.[6]"

        "description": " Silurus callichthys Linnaeus, 1758 Callichthys callichthys, the cascarudo, armored catfish, bubblenest catfish, hassar, or mailed catfish, is a subtropical freshwater fish belonging to the subfamily Callichthyinae of the family Callichthyidae. It was originally described as Silurus callichthys by Linnaeus in 1758.[1] It is likely to represent a species complex.[2] C. callichthys is distributed in all major river drainages of South America.[2] It is very wide-ranging, extending from Trinidad to  Buenos Aires, Argentina, including the upper Amazon River and Paraguay River systems. The fish will grow in length up to eight inches (20 centimeters).  The females are larger and more robust, and are a dull olive-green, while the males are brighter in color, exhibiting a delicate blue or violet sheen laterally, with a more developed and longer pectoral fin spine that is reddish-brown and edged with orange or reddish-orange. It lives in a variety of water types, from anoxic conditions (slack water zones surrounded by dense vegetation) to slightly turbid, but free-flowing, streams.[1] It can be found in waters with pH range of 5.8 to 8.3, a water hardness of 0\u201330dGH, and a temperature range of 64\u201383\u00a0\u00b0F (18\u201328\u00a0\u00b0C).[1] When its biotype becomes dry, it can move out of the water, due to its ability to swallow air and use its intestines to absorb oxygen from the atmosphere, to find more water.[1] It feeds at night on fish, insects, and plant matter.  Juveniles feed on rotifers, in addition to the microcrustaceans and aquatic insect larvae they find when digging into the substrate.[1] During reproduction, the male's belly turns orange and its pectoral spines become longer and thicker.  The male builds a bubble nest with some floating plants, fiercely guarding it after the female lays down her eggs.[1] The cascarudo is of commercial importance in the aquarium trade industry and of minor importance as a food source.[1] It can be kept in aquariums, with groups of more than five individuals recommended.[1]"

        "description": " Megalechis thoracata (black marble hoplo, spotted hoplo[1]) is a species of catfish of the family Callichthyidae.  M. thoracata is found east of the Andes in the Amazon, Orinoco, and upper Paraguay River basins, as well as in the coastal rivers of the Guianas and northern Brazil. Recent introductions were recorded in the upper Paran\u00e1 River drainage.[2] Overview: The Spotted Hoplo Catfish is an incredibly hardy and relatively easy species to keep in captivity, with the main difficulty being the maximum size of around 6 inches, or 15\u00a0cm.They are a very peaceful fish, with the only exception being when the males are guarding a bubble nest at breeding time. They can be kept with almost all tankmates, but they will likely eat anything that can fit in their mouths due to their opportunistic nature. This rule also applies for larger fish, as the Hoplo may get eaten or have its barbels or fins damaged by large, potentially aggressive fish, such as South American Cichlids, African Cichlids, larger catfish and most larger fish species that can fit the Hoplo in its mouth or shows aggression. Tank Setup: They require a soft sand substrate, as they are bottom dwellers that can often be observed foraging/searching for food. A gentle substrate is essential, as other coarse grained or abrasive substrates can irritate the fish's sensitive barbels, and even cause them to fall off. To thrive in the aquarium, they need a minimum tank size of 55 US liquid gallons, but as a rule of thumb for this fish, the larger the tank, the better.[3][4] They are semi-social creatures that prefer to be kept in groups of at least five, but still seem content alone or in pairs. The spotted hoplo catfish needs hiding places, usually in the form of rocks, wood and plants, such as variations of Anubias, valisineria, java fern and micranthemum. Floating plants are also appreciated, as they provide extra cover. Water Conditions: Despite the Hoplo being a very hardy fish, like all fish they need a mature, cycled tank with the correct parameters for almost all tropical species. As they are a species of tropical fish, the optimal temperature for them is around 24\u201328 degrees Celsius, but they can adapt to temperatures in the 22\u201330 degrees Celsius range, although this is not recommended and over a long period of time this can lead to elevated stress levels, amongst other health concerns. The natural habitat of Megalechis thoracata is slow flowing, low oxygen parts of the  Amazon, Orinoco, and upper Paraguay River basins. For this reason, catfish of the family Callichthyidae among other fish, have developed a unique way of breathing, where the fish will rise to the surface of the water and ingest a small amount of air.[5] The oxygen is then absorbed through the lining of the stomach and intestine. This is known as gastrointestinal respiration. They will feed on small to medium-sized worms and other invertebrates, small fish, and general detritus. M. thoracata has been observed to produce sounds during territorial behavior in males at their nest sites and especially during spawning, and during aggressive behavior in both sexes. M. thoracata males aggressively defend territories against intruders.[6]"

        "description": " Ancistrus is a genus of nocturnal freshwater fish in the family Loricariidae of order Siluriformes, native to freshwater habitats in South America and Panama. Fish of this genus are common in the aquarium trade where they are known as bushynose or bristlenose catfish. In the aquarium hobby they are often referred to as bushynose or bristlenose plecos instead, but this may lead to confusion as \"pleco\" usually is used for Hypostomus plecostomus and its allies and is often used as a catchall term for any loricariids remotely resembling that species. The type species is Ancistrus cirrhosus.[1] This genus is the largest genus within the tribe Ancistrini.[2] The name ancistrus derives from the Ancient Greek agkistron \"hook\"\u00a0\u2013 a reference to the form of the cheek odontodes. The genera Pristiancistrus, Thysanocara and Xenocara are now synonyms of Ancistrus.[2] Ancistrus species show all the typical features of the Loricariidae. This includes a body covered in bony plates and a ventral suckermouth.[3] The feature most commonly associated with the genus are the fleshy tentacles found on the head in adult males; females may possess tentacles along the snout margin but they are smaller and they lack tentacles on the head.[3] Tentacules, tentacles directly associated with odontodes, develop on the pectoral fin spine of the males of some species.[3] Males also have evertible cheek odontodes which are less developed or absent in females. They also lack odontodes along the snout.[2] In comparison with a typical loricariid (pleco), a bristlenose is typically shorter (4\u20136 inches or 15\u00a0cm or less), more flattened and fatter with a comparatively wider head. Colouration is typically mottled brown, grey or black. Small white or yellow spots are common.[2] In contrast to many other loricariid 'plecos' (many of which regularly exceed a foot in captivity), the bristlenose plecos do not usually exceed six inches in length; they can thus be kept in relatively small tanks, contributing to their popularity in the aquarium hobby. Ancistrus species are unusual among vertebrates in possessing an X0 sex-determination system, which is the prevailing method in many lineages of arthropod but is very rare elsewhere in the animal kingdom.[4] Ancistrus is one of the widest ranging Loricariid genera, and representatives are found in most areas where the family in general is present.[2] Many species are found in the rivers and floodplain areas of the Amazon basin, but there are also species elsewhere in tropical South America, as well as species on the island of Trinidad and two species, A. centrolepis and A. chagresi in Panama.[5] Three species are true cavefish (troglobites): A. cryptophthalmus, A. galani and A. formoso.[6][7] These are the only known loricariids that possess adaptions for a subterranean lifestyle, such as reduced pigmentation (appearing overall whitish) and eyes.[6] In the wild, Ancistrus species prefer flowing water, so tanks with flow are typically used when keeping them in captivity. Since they are bottom-dwelling fish, substrate is considered preferable to a bare tank floor. Mixtures of gravel, dirt, and clay are frequently used as substrate for Ancistrus. The aquarium size that is considered by some to be a minimum for fish of this genus is 25 gallons.[8] There are currently 76 recognized species in this genus:[9] The diet of this genus is typical for a Loricariid\u00a0\u2013 algae, aufwuchs, and detritus, with sediment, sand, and gravel presumably ingested accidentally alongside food items.[13][14][15][16][17][18] Despite reports among fish-keepers that they require wood in their diet, no scientific evidence to date supports members of this genus feeding on wood.  Bristlenoses do not school but hide when not feeding, juveniles however are typically found in brightly lit shallows at the water margin making them susceptible to predation by birds. Ancistrus species have the capability of obtaining oxygen through their modified stomach.[19] This allows them to survive in conditions with low oxygen levels.[2] Breeding takes place in hollows, caves and mud holes in banks. Males may clean the inside of the cavity with their suckermouth before allowing the female to approach and inspect the nest.  Courtship includes expanding the dorsal and caudal fins and attempts by the male to escort the female to the nest. While the female inspects the nest, the male keeps close contact.[3] The female may lay 20\u2013200 adhesive eggs, usually to the ceiling of the cavity.[3] The female plays no role in parental care; the male takes care of its young. Males will clean the eggs and the cavity with its fins and mouth. Males inspect eggs to remove diseased or infertile eggs, and aerates the clutch by fanning them with its pectoral and pelvic fins.[3] During this time, a male usually will not leave the cavity to feed, or will leave only occasionally and quickly return.[3] The eggs hatch in 4\u201310 days over a period of 2\u20136 hours; the male guards the eggs for 7\u201310 days after hatching.[3] The fry remain in the cave, attaching to the walls and ceiling with their mouths, absorbing their yolk sac in 2\u20134 days and becoming free swimming.[3] Males of these species are competitive and territorial. Males display to each other by positioning themselves parallel to each other, head to tail, with dorsal and caudal fins erect and cheek odontode spines everted. If this escalates to combat, the males will circle each other and direct attacks at the head.[3] If an intruding male manages to evict another male from the nest, it may cannibalize the other male's young.[3] A male bristlenose may guard several clutches of eggs simultaneously. Females prefer males that are already protecting eggs and may prefer males that are protecting larvae; it has been suggested that the tentacles may act as a fry mimic to attract females, which would allow males without eggs in their nest to compete with males guarding eggs.[3] Several clutches in various states of development from eggs to free-swimming larvae can be found in one nest.[2] These fish are often kept by aquarists, as they are dutiful algae-eaters and smaller in adult size than the common plecos usually seen in pet shops. They reach up to 15\u00a0cm in males, and 12\u00a0cm in females. Their recommended temperature is 23\u201327 degrees Celsius. Their lifespan is up to 12 years. They are hardy animals, tolerant to a wide range of water conditions. They breed easily in captivity, and are compatible with most other freshwater fish. Though typically mottled brown or black-and-grey spotted in color, other species are more exotic\u00a0\u2013 spots of bright yellow on a dark background being a common pattern. Albino variants are also common. The albino morph is not caused by exposure to light during development, it is a morph controlled by genetics.[20] Historically, commonly available species of Ancistrus were Ancistrus cirrhosus and Ancistrus temminckii; other species are now available, though exact identification is difficult. Feeding is easy, bristlenoses will graze on algae/ algae wafers and other surface growing organisms as well as eating algae wafers or tablets, flake food, squash, spinach, cucumber, zucchini, green beans peas and even sliced carrots. They have also been known to accept frozen bloodworms as part of their diet. Aquarium specimens may starve for lack of algae or other plant matter; algae wafers or other low-protein foods are recommended. Keepers should watch for the abdomen to take on a sunken appearance, indicating insufficient nutrition. Sexing is very easy as the female will only occasionally have bristles, around the edge of the chin, whereas the male will have them up the center of the head. Breeding is also possible. Males attract females to a small cave or hollow, then guard eggs after fertilization through hatching (4\u20138 days) until fry are free swimming (4\u20136 days after hatching); the aquarist need only supply a suitable cave, food, and one of each sex. Caution should be taken with the spines (odontodes)\u00a0; although the risk of personal injury is small with this genus, the hooked nature of the odontodes means that a bristlenose may become trapped in non-natural material such as sponge filters and netting."

They inhabit flowing sections of rivers, especially clearwater, in the basins of the Amazon (notably Trombetas, Tapaj\u00f3s, Xingu and Tocantins) and Orinoco (notably Ventuari) in Brazil and Venezuela. The largest species reach up to 34\u00a0cm (13\u00a0in) in total length.[2] Most Baryancistrus are differentiated from other related genera by a membrane connecting their dorsal fin and adipose fin, not present in most other genera.[3] The species of this genus are mainly herbivores and detritivores, but may take other foods in an aquarium setting. Most have probably not been bred in captivity. It is difficult to sex these fish, including adult specimens. These fish are mainly nocturnal, but will also emerge from their hiding places during the day, after some time getting accustomed to the aquarium. Adequate hiding places are recommended for these fish due to their primary nocturnal nature. There are currently eight recognized species in this genus:[2][4] Though there are many types of fish described as Baryancistrus, there are many that yet to be given a true scientific designation, and are only referred to under the L-number system, including the Gold Nuggets. Here is a list of Baryancistrus by L-number designation. The common name and scientific name are included when available, though some of these fish are only commonly referred to by their L-number. For those fish without a scientific name, they are assumed to be Baryancistrus sp. * Note: L200 is also used to refer to Hemiancistrus subviridis, another Loricariid that is very similar in appearance to B. demantoides.

        "description": " Rineloricaria (from the Greek, rhinos meaning nose, and the Latin, lorica meaning cuirass of leather) is a genus of freshwater tropical catfish (order Siluriformes) belonging to the family Loricariidae. They are commonly called whiptail catfish because of the long filament that grows out of the tip of the caudal fin that is characteristic of the genus. With the exception of R. altipinnis from Panama, they are native to the rivers of northern and central South America. Some species are regularly seen in the aquarium trade. This genus was described by Pieter Bleeker in 1862, with R. lima as the type species.[1] This genus is by far one of the most speciose of the subfamily Loricariinae, containing about 30 species.[2] On the other hand, it is one of the least resolved genera.[3] In 2008, 14 new species were added to this genus.[2][4][5][6][7] Hemiloricaria, Fonchiiichthys, and Leliella been variably considered synonyms of Rineloricaria; these genera were erected to account for differences in sexually dimorphic traits. However, the traits used to diagnose these genera have been thought to be insufficient.[2] There are currently 67 recognized species in this genus:[8] The genus is widely distributed on nearly the entire subcontinent, from Costa Rica to Argentina, on both slopes of the Andes.[11] Rineloricaria species are found in a large variety of habitats, including large rivers, streams, and lagoons, associated with bottoms consisting of sand or rocks, sometimes found in marginal vegetation. They are also found to tolerate environments with a wide temperature gradient.[6] Rineloricaria have an adaptive capacity enabling many species to exploit the most varied habitats; some species, such as R. strigilata, have been caught in highly polluted bodies of water and represent some of the main components of the ichthyological diversity in such habitats.[3] The average length of a Rineloricaria catfish is about 13\u00a0cm (5\u00a0in) long.[citation needed] The fish are long, slender, have no visible barbels, an erect dorsal fin, a very thin caudal peduncle, and a narrow face. The coloration of the fishes is usually light brown with darker blotches, and have a dark dorsal fin.[citation needed] They are also covered with bony plates and have a sucker disk mouth, as is common with most fish in the family Loricariidae. Sexual dimorphism includes hypertrophied development of the odontodes along the sides of the head, on the pectoral spines and rays, and predorsal area of mature males. Several species also show hypertrophied development of the odontodes on the entire caudal peduncle.[11] In males, the pectoral fin spine is often thick, short, and curved when compared to the female.[2] Rineloricaria are cavity brooders. Numerous eggs (often more than 100) are laid attached to one another in single layer masses on the cavity floor, and are brooded by males.[11] Rineloricaria exhibit high levels of karyotypic diversity with chromosome numbers ranging from 36 to 70.[11]"

        "description": " The genus Panaque contains a small number of small to medium-sized South American suckermouth armoured catfishes that are notable for being among the very few vertebrates that feed extensively on wood.[1]  In addition, algae and aufwuchs are an important part of the diet, and they use their rasping teeth to scrape this from rocks. These fish are also popular aquarium fish, where the sound of scraping as these fish forage for food is easily audible.[citation needed] Scobinancistrus and Panaqolus are sometimes considered to be subgenera of this genus.[2] There are currently seven recognized species in this genus:[3] The name Panaque is a Latinisation of a native Venezuelan name for these fish. It is pronounced \"pan ack\" in Britain and Europe, but often as \"pan aki\" or \"pan a kay\" in America. The Japanese call these fish \"pana koo ee\".[citation needed] Panaque are found in the Magdalena River, Orinoco River, Amazon River, Essequibo River, and Lake Maracaibo drainages.[5] All Panaque come from tropical South American and inhabit fast-flowing streams and rivers. They are weak swimmers but like other armoured catfish possess a strong sucker-like mouth with which they can hold on to submerged rocks and wood.[citation needed] Like other members of the armoured catfish family (Loricariidae), all Panaque have sturdy, armoured bodies covered in toughened plates of skin called scutes. These are not scales; like all catfish, Panaque lack scales. As well their armour, these catfish have very sturdy dorsal and pectoral fin spines. They use these defensively, either to wedge themselves into cracks from which predators cannot pull them, or else to prevent large predators from swallowing them. Another characteristic typical of the armoured catfish family is an iris. Most fish are unable to regulate the amount of light that enters the eye since they have irises that cannot change size. Both male and female Panaque develop bristles, known as odontodes, on the side of head immediately before and onto the pectoral fins.[citation needed] Unlike predatory catfish, these omnivorous catfish have very short barbels. These barbels can be seen in the photograph of mouth of a Panaque shown here; they are the short pointed structures on either side of a suckermouth. This sucker-like mouth allows them to attach to rocks and remain stationary with very little expenditure of energy.[citation needed] Along with the species of the Hypostomus cochliodon group (formerly the genus Cochliodon), it has been argued that Panaque are the only fish that can eat and digest wood.[5] Possible adaptations to consuming wood include spoon-shaped, scraper-like teeth and highly angled jaws to chisel wood.[5] Researchers have also identified symbiotic gut bacteria that may allow the fish to digest the wood they consume.[6] However, others have argued that Panaque do not in fact digest wood, and in fact take up very little energy from the wood they consume and actually lose weight when fed just wood.[7] Furthermore, their digestive tracts are no different from those of related catfish and they do not hold wood particles in the gut longer than other catfish, suggesting Panaque are not physically adapted to eating wood, and are in fact detritivores much like other Loricariidae.[7] In September 2010 scientists from the US National Science Foundation claimed to have discovered a new species of wood-eating catfish in the Alto Pur\u00fas National Park, Peru.[8] Several species of Panaque have become popular aquarium fish. The brightly coloured Panaque nigrolineatus is particularly popular and is known as the \"royal panaque\" or \"royal pleco\", monikers which reflect its comparative costliness and beauty over the common pleco. Royal plecos have a greyish-green base color against which thick, dark bluish-black stripes are set; their fins are edged with gold or cream, and their eyes are red. In captivity, royal plecos typically grow to around 30\u00a0centimeters in length.[9] A second species, Panaque cochliodon, is familiar to many aquarists as the \"blue-eyed pleco\". Though the blue-eyed pleco was widely traded in the late 1980s and early 1990s, it is now only rarely exported from its native Colombia.[10] It is also associated with the binomina Panaque suttonorum and P. suttoni, though Panaque suttonorum is a different fish which only comes from Venezuela. Blue-eyed plecos reach a similar size to royal plecos, but because many specimens are infected with a bacterium closely related to Rickettsia, mortality immediately after import can be high.[11] However, once they have settled in and begun feeding, they are no more difficult to keep than royal plecos.[citation needed] All Panaque catfish require much the same care in captivity. Panaque mainly demand a mixed diet including green algae, fresh vegetables such as carrots, courgettes, and spinach, but because they are argued to be xylophagous, many aquarists provide driftwood for them to graze upon, as well. The meaty foods enjoyed by other plecos are not required. Because they are relatively big for aquarium fish and produce an unusually large amount of waste, a high-capacity tank and filter are essential. Royal panaques tolerate a wider range of water chemistry than others\u2014they prefer somewhat soft, slightly acid water but they will tolerate hard, alkaline water.[citation needed] In terms of behavior, Panaque are peaceful and nocturnal bottom-dwellers which make good residents in community tanks. Like most of the other armored catfish, they are territorial, and groups should only be kept in very large tanks.[citation needed]"

P. genibarbis may be completely dark brown to black, mottled with tan to dark brown background and black streaks, or light tan with large, sparse spots located at base of lateral plates, fin membranes, and abdomen.[3] Males have longer odontodes on the cheek that are denser and more numerous than in females. It has been suggested that breeding males may also have orange on the cheeks and dorsal and caudal fin spines, although this may be restricted to fish from the Branco River.[3] P. genibarbis is found in small, sluggish streams, floodplain lakes, and large rivers.[3] Water quality measurements showed that the water tended to be low in oxygen, but neutral (pH\u00a07.0).[1] P. genibarbis is able to swallow air, like many other Loricariids. However, this species is not an obligate air-breather.[1] When disturbed, it is able to swallow air to become neutrally buoyant and swim in the water column.[1] This species is an armored catfish which, since the 1990s, has started to be offered quite regularly as an aquarium fish under the name \"Pineapple Pleco\".[citation needed] The term \"pleco\" here is of course a popular generalisation, as taxonomy has never placed this fish in the former genus Plecostomus. The armour is also pleasantly spiked along the sides of the fish, which causes the pineapple resemblance celebrated in the commercial name of the species. Additionally, under the L-number system used by hobbyists, it as referred to as both L152 and L095. There is quite a degree of colour variation, which is probably the main reason for the confusion over species. Some males having orange cheeks, which is why \"orange cheek Pleco\" is another common name found in circulation.[4] This is not made any easier by the fact that the fish will gradually darken if left in a tank with a darker substrate and lighten when kept on a lighter substrate. These changes take some time (hours or days) to effect, they do not happen quickly, so there is no real \"chameleon\" effect here, but no doubt it is a useful survival mechanism.[citation needed] From the viewpoint of the aquarist the fish is peaceful, sociable with others of its own type, non-territorial and omnivorous. Unsurprisingly, therefore, they do well in soft water, although pH values of up to 7.5 are acceptable, and the temperature range may fluctuate gently between 23-27\u00a0\u00b0C (73.4-80.6\u00a0\u00b0F.[4] Spawning in captivity has not yet been reliably reported.[4] Sexual dimorphism is slight, being determined mainly by a more rounded body shape in the females, and orange \"cheeks\", this refers to the operculum, in the males. The fish will, unlike most hypostomines, feed on flake from the water surface, turning upside-down to do so.[citation needed] It is also able to augment water-dissolved oxygen with atmospheric oxygen, but does not need to do so, having fully functional gills, so when this fish does gulp it is a useful warning that the aeration in the tank is low.[1]"

Identification is relatively difficult as there are many different similar species labelled as \"common pleco\". This species has a light brown coloration with a pattern of darker brown spots (its specific epithet, punctatus, means \"spotted\"). Because of this, the species may also be known as the spotted hypostomus. The species is not notably striped and is generally lighter in coloration than H. plecostomus.[2] H. punctatus is found in the wild in fast-flowing rivers as well as in flooded areas. It prefers water with a temperature of 22\u201328\u00a0\u00b0C, a pH range of 5\u20138, and a dH range of 0.5\u201325.[1] H. punctatus is primarily herbivorous and feeds on algae and detritus as well as plants and roots.[1]"

Although the name Hypostomus plecostomus is often used to refer to common plecostomus sold in aquarium shops, most are actually members of other genera.[3][1] Suckermouth catfish are of little or no value as a food fish, although they are at least occasionally consumed over their native range.[citation needed] A demand exists for them, however, as a bottom cleaner in the aquarium trade.[4] This species' native range is tropical northeastern South America; it naturally occurs in northeastern Brazil, the Guianas, and Trinidad and Tobago.[5] Confusingly, the name Hypostomus plecostomus (or Plecostomus plecostomus) has sometimes been incorrectly used for several more-or-less similar loricariid catfishes, both in the popular and scientific literature. For example, it has sometimes been suggested that it occurs in southern Central America, but this is an entirely separate species, Hemiancistrus aspidolepis (also known under another synonym, Hypostomus panamensis).[6][7] Some Loricariidae species have been widely introduced to several countries around the world and reported as H. plecostomus.[5] It is erroneous,[1] and the concerned species belong to the genus Pterygoplichthys (either P. pardalis,[8] P. disjunctivus,[9] P. anisitsi[10] or P. multiradiatus[11]). In the United States, a Pterygoplichthys species has been introduced to some regions in the South, most likely released by aquarists into the local waters. For example, they are present in a lake in the neighborhood of Hammock Trace Preserve in Melbourne, Florida. In Texas, reproducing populations occur in spring-influenced habitats of the San Antonio River (Bexar County), Comal Springs (Comal County), San Marcos River (Hays County), and San Felipe Creek (Val Verde County), as well as in drainage canals in the Rio Grande Valley and Houston.[12][13] The same identification issues have spread in the literature regarding the invasive catfishes in Taiwan, with H. plecostomus being one of the numerous names used to designate the species: DNA studies showed the alien fishes were actually P. pardalis and P. disjunctivus (that hybridise extensively).[14] H. plecostomus prefer to live in water between 72 and 86 degrees Fahrenheit (~22.2 to 30 degrees Celsius), with a pH between 6.5 and 7.5.[15] Hypostomus plecostomus is named for its sucker-like mouth, which allows it to adhere to a surface, as well as to hold and rasp at food, including newly hatched and baby golden apple snails as well as Malaysian trumpet snails.[16] This omnivorous species also feeds on algae, aquatic plants, and small crustaceans.[17][citation needed] Hypostomus plecostomus is one of many species of fish that is able to breathe air. Hypostomus plecostomus relies on its gills for respiration in normal and slightly hypoxic water, and the less oxygen present in the water, the more frequently it surfaces to breathe air.[18] The air is taken to the stomach where the oxygen is absorbed, and the air can be kept in the stomach to increase buoyancy, which may help it to feed on vegetation.[19] H. plecostomus is one of a number of species commonly referred to as \"plecostomus\" or \"common pleco\" by aquarists.  These fish are sold when they are young and small, but in the wild, they can grow to be a maximum size of 50 centimetres (20\u00a0in).[20] In captivity, however, a full-grown Hypostomus plecostomus only reaches 15 inches (38\u00a0cm) on average, which could be explained by the subpar oxygen levels in most home aquaria and other practices of bad fish husbandry.[21] In the aquarium trade, this dark-colored, bottom-feeding, nocturnal catfish is often purchased for its ability to clean algae from fish tanks but also contributes a lot of waste to the nitrogen cycle. They are difficult for other fish to harass, both due to the semi-aggressive nature of the fish as well as its thick armor.[22] In Bangladesh, the species, among some other suckermouth catfishes has become invasive. The government is currently on its way to impose a ban on the farming, hatchling production, breeding, marketing and trading of the fish.[23] It has also raised serious concern in India and Sri Lanka.[24] A large variety of common names is used to describe H. plecostomus, where plecostomus and the shortened \"pleco\" are interchangeable in all common names. The names include: The species' scientific name, Hypostomus plecostomus, is derived from the Latin hypo (meaning \"under\"), stoma (meaning \"mouth\"), and pleco (meaning \"pleated\").[citation needed] Many of the common names used to identify Hypostomus plecostomus are also used for other species, which augments the confusion surrounding H. plecostomus and other Loricariidae such as H. punctatus, Pterygoplichthys multiradiatus and P. pardalis. In 2012, Weber, Covain, and Fisch-Muller showed the type series of Carl Linnaeus was heterogenous and comprised two species: H. plecostomus (for which the authors designate a lectotype) and H. watwata.[1]"

Pterygoplichthys gibbiceps shows all the characteristic features of its genus\u2014a large dorsal fin with more than nine rays, prominent nasal flares and a prominent hump or crest anterior to the dorsal fin as well as a substantial base to the dorsal fin. Adult fish easily attain a length of 50.0 centimetres (19.7\u00a0in) TL and can live for more than 20 years. A typical plec shape is shown, patternation consists of primarily irregular largish brown spots on a yellowish backgroung giving a honeycombed like appearance, additional pattern features common to related species may be visible on close inspection. As this fish grows the spots get smaller. Like most plecs this species is primarily herbivorous though will eat dead animals. In the wild these fish are found in shoals in sluggish rivers of the Amazon and Orinoco river systems, they also occupy flooded land during the wet season. During the dry season P. gibbiceps will aestivate in burrows around 1 metre long dug into mud banks along the length of a river, egg rearing is also presumed to take place in burrow. The species name comes from the Latin gibbus\u2014hump, and caput\u2014head, a reference to the centrally located ridge. Common names include 'gibbys', leopard sailfin catfish and clown plecs\u2014the juveniles have a comical appearance due to the large and obvious spots. Ancistrus gibbiceps and Glyptoperichthys gibbiceps are synonyms of P. gibbiceps.\nThe fish has recently been caught from river Ganges, Banaras and is suspected to be yet another entrant to Invasive exotic list of fish in India. This fish is extremely popular in the aquarium, due to its unusual appearance and its ability to eat algae; the bane of all aquarists. This and other related species are bred in ponds in tropical regions for the aquarium trade. In general P. gibbiceps is peaceful towards other fish though territorial disputes arise with other plecos and fish of a similar or larger size. Though not nocturnal they are more active at night and will spend daylight hours 'hiding' in a secluded location. As the fish grows big (up to 60.96\u00a0cm in the aquarium) a large tank with good filtration is required, in general these fish are tolerant to a wide range of freshwater conditions though prefer well aerated water. The fish will 'gulp' surface air in poorly oxygenated water. A lesser-known trait is its mild camouflage ability, where it can lighten or darken its scales in a tiger-stripe pattern. It may reflect its mood or comfortability with the water parameters.[2][3] Pterygoplichthys gibbiceps is an omnivore. They can be fed with vegetables such as nettles, lettuce, spinach or carrots. Their diet can include meat; such as earthworms, blood worms or chopped shrimps.  They will also eat prepared foods from a pet shop, especially sinking algae wafers. The best way to breed Pterygoplichthys gibbiceps is to feed them with wide spectrum of food. With a good diet, they will grow quickly (up to 30 centimetres in one year). Adult Pterygoplichthys gibbiceps  may eat many aquarium plants. It can be almost impossible to differentiate males from females. Males in a group can be determined as they may become more territorial. Reproduction involves females laying roes into caves or hollows of roots. There is a high rate of mortality until the spawn are five centimeters long. The reason for this is unknown."

        "description": " The zebra pleco (Hypancistrus zebra) is a species of catfish endemic to a small section of the Rio Xingu in Brazil. It occurs in the big bend area of the river, downstream from the town of Altamira, Para. It was first described in 1991.[3] It gets its name from its black and white stripes, resembling the colouration of a zebra. This species grows to a length of 6.4 centimetres (2.5\u00a0in) SL.[3] This species was exported from Brazil in 1987 for sale as aquarium fish. However, currently, the Brazilian government bans the export of certain fish species, including H. zebra. H. zebra is threatened by the Belo Monte Dam in the Xingu river which has caused a severe reduction of the water flow of the entire known distribution range of the species. Due to this, the species has been classified as critically endangered and may soon become extinct in the wild. It is subject to several captive breeding programs. It is commercially bred in captivity for the aquarium trade. Mature males have a wider head and longer interopercular spines than females. After spawning, the males will guard the eggs. The fry swim after seven days and absorb the yolk sac in two weeks.[4] The minimum tank size for the species is said to be a minimum of 30 gallons (approximately 115 liters).\u00a0Maintaining water parameters at certain levels is also of importance when keeping them in an aquarium. The ideal water temperature for their tank is about 79\u201388\u00a0\u00b0F (26\u201331\u00a0\u00b0C). Reasonable water acidity levels are 6.5 pH to 7.0 pH with the water hardness ranging between 2 and 6 dKH.[5] Hypancistrus zebra can be referred to using the L-numbering convention often applied to Loricariidae, although, unlike most loricariids, H. zebra has two associated L-numbers: L-046 and L-098 both refer to the species. H. zebra is a predator and requires a high protein diet, typically including small invertebrates such as insect larvae. When in captivity, the species is often fed fresh or frozen bloodworms, brine shrimp and algae wafers. Occasionally, the species may be fed vegetables such as lettuce, cucumber, and squash.[5] This species should not be kept in the typical community aquarium, or with discus, despite advice to the contrary. These catfish thrive in biotopes with small dither fish which do not compete with H. zebra for food. The tank should mimic their natural environment with a substrate of small smooth gravel and pebbles with smooth boulders, cobbles and rocks forming caves and crevices.[6] The water must be highly oxygenated with a strong flow and surface agitation. It is an expensive species because it can only be collected or reproduced in small numbers. It is a simple fish to keep but it needs clean, warm water and a fast-moving current. They are unlikely to survive in still water or a dirty environment.[4] It is nocturnal, moderately territorial, and prefers plenty of hiding places.[4] In 2004, the zebra pleco was added to the IBAMA list of endangered species and exporting it from Brazil was made illegal. However, this law is only present in Brazil and black market fish traders smuggle them out of Brazil to then sell in other countries (primarily Colombia). Similarly to other Hypancistrus species, the male will trap the female in a cave where she will lay her eggs for the male to fertilise. This is usually done at around a pH of 6.5-7.2 and a water temp of 27\u00b0. This process can take between 1 and 5 days depending on the experience the female has in motherhood. The male will often bite the female to keep her in the cave, which is a natural behaviour for the species. Once the eggs are fertilised, the female will leave, although the male will guard the eggs until they hatch and may even stay to see them develop into fry. Once born, the fry will have a yolk sack attached to their underbelly, which is typically gone in a few days.[7] The species is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that international trade (including in captive bred specimens) is regulated by the CITES permitting system.[2]"

P. multiradiatus is one of a number of species commonly referred to as the common pleco by aquarists.[1] Other scientific names that were used (as synonyms) for P. multiradiatus include Hypostomus multiradiatus, Ancistrus multiradiatus, and Liposarcus multiradiatus. P. multiradiatus is sometimes confused with Pterygoplichthys pardalis, which is a different species of pleco. P. multiradiatus goes by a number of common names. It can be called the \"long-fin armored catfish\" in Hawaii, \"sailfin catfish\", \"sailfish catfish\", \"many-rayed (multiradiatus) pleco\" or \"radiated ptero\" in the United States, \u591a\u8f3b\u7ffc\u7532\u9bf0 in Mandarin Chinese.\nP. multiradiatus is mottled brown/black and inhabits freshwater streams and lakes and in weedy, mud-bottomed canals in its native habitat: the Orinoco River basin in Venezuela. Its geographic distribution is 10\u00b0N - 1\u00b0N, 68\u00b0W - 61\u00b0W. This tropical, nocturnal bottom-dweller likes warm water at the temperature range of 23\u201327\u00a0\u00b0C, pH range: 6.5\u20137.8, and dH range: 4\u201320. P. multiradiatus browses on substrate, mainly feeding on benthic algae and aquatic weeds, but will also take worms, insect larvae and other bottom-dwelling invertebrates as food. One of the large plecos (growing to a maximum of 50.0 centimetres (19.7\u00a0in) TL), this species likes solitude, is relatively peaceful as an aquarium fish and does well with cichlids and other big fish, and should be kept in large tanks only and with plenty of rocks and driftwood in which to hide. Like many other plecos, it is very important in the aquarium trade. P. multiradiatus has been introduced to Taiwan,[2] Puerto Rico,[3] Florida, Hawaii, Texas, India, and Mexico,[4] most likely as the result of escapes or releases from aquarium fish farms. This species is firmly established in these and other locations, where it is regarded as a harmful invasive species being relatively inedible to people and predators, causing damage to fishing gear, competing and harming against native species and disrupting environments by its burrowing activities.[4] In this context its relative, Hypostomus plecostomus, has also been similarly implicated though it seems likely that in Asia, both or related species are implicated."

        "description": " The zebra oto or tiger oto (Otocinclus cocama) is a fish of the genus Otocinclus of the family Loricariidae that originates from Peru. The zebra oto was described in 2004 from a tributary of the R\u00edo Ucayali in Peru.[2] Its closest relatives appear to be O. huaorani, O. bororo, O. mariae, and O. mura, as well as the more recently described species O. batmani.[3] This fish is found in Peru in the Ucayali River and possibly Mara\u00f1\u00f3n River as well. These fish are found in mid-sized creeks with clear water. It may also be found in small ponds.[1] They associate with marginal vegetation.[2] The zebra oto has a general body-shape like other Otocinclus species. They are small, have a suckermouth, and have armor on their bodies. The zebra oto can be distinguished from all other members of this genus by its vertical stripe-like blotches and its complete lateral line. The zebra oto has the highest number of teeth of any species of Otocinclus. The W mark on its caudal fin distinguishes this fish from all others except for O. batmani. The zebra oto reaches about 4.4\u00a0cm (1.7\u00a0in) in SL, though the males are smaller.[2] The zebra oto is listed as endangered by the IUCN Red List due to its limited range and overexploitation for the aquarium trade. Additionally, it is not protected in any part of its range, nor is it listed on CITES. The species has a decreasing population trend in the wild.[1] The zebra oto has been for sale in the aquarium trade since the early 1990s. It has been popular since at least 2000.[2] They are an occasionally seen species, and are bred in Asia in good numbers.[4]"

By numbering systems such as the L-number system, this fish may also be known as L104, L162, or LDA22.[1] This fish is endemic to Venezuela where it is found in the tannic Apur\u00e9 and Caron\u00ed River basins.[2] Their natural environment is driftwood tangles near riverbanks.[1] This species is a small loricariid. It reaches a length of 8.8 centimetres (3.5\u00a0in) SL.[2] This species has a striped pattern. However, this colouration may change with age. There are specimens with straight bars, but there are also specimens with a broken or wavy pattern. The wavy pattern form is found in the actual Orinoco and its tributaries in Bolivar State, Venezuela, while the \"normal\" patterned P. maccus comes from further north and west (Cojedes, Portuguesa, Guarico, and Apure States) in the Llanos where the drainages run into the Apure River.[1] Panaqolus maccus is one of the most common species of small, striped loricariids available in the fishkeeping hobby. This species adapts well to aquarium life.[1] They are not too difficult to spawn.[1] It should always be provided with enough driftwood in the tank, as it is a wood-eating fish. However fresh vegetables, spirulina and frozen foods such as bloodworms are recommended to be given as well from time to time. They are very peaceful fish suited for the average community tank. They are a hardy species of catfish and can tolerate various water parameters but prefer softer, more acidic water. Good filtration is needed because of the large amounts of waste they produce, caused by their wood-based diet. It is suited for tanks starting from 15 gallons.[1] It is difficult to successfully breed these fish in captivity. The tank setting and water parameters must be as near to their native habitat as possible. Seasonal changes can be simulated by adjusting the pH and temperature of the water. Soft driftwoods and cave formations give ample hiding places for the females to feel comfortable, and they may deposit eggs at some point.[3]"

        "description": " The redtail catfish, Phractocephalus hemioliopterus, is a pimelodid (long-whiskered) catfish. In Venezuela, it is known as cajaro, in Guyana, it is known as a banana catfish, and in Brazil, it is known as pirarara,[2] stemming from the Tupi language words pir\u00e1 and arara.[3] It is the only extant species of the genus Phractocephalus. This fish is common in the aquarium trade, although its massive adult size makes it unsuitable for all but the largest aquariums.[4] They feed on fish, crustaceans and fallen fruits.[5] They are not evaluated by IUCN. Although the redtail catfish is the only living representative of this genus, there are other members that date back to the upper Miocene, and are only known from fossil remains. P.\u00a0nassi was described in 2003, from the Urumaco Formation at Urumaco, Venezuela. Another fossil species, P.\u00a0acreornatus, is known from the Solim\u00f5es Formation, Acre, Brazil.[1][2] This genus has a minimum age of about 13.5\u00a0million years.[2] Phractocephalus hemioliopterus can reach about 1.8\u00a0m (5\u00a0ft 11\u00a0in) in length, and about 80\u00a0kg (180\u00a0lb) in weight.[6] However, this is exceptionally rare, and most do not approach this size. They average 3\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in\u00a0\u2013 4\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in; 1.1\u20131.4\u00a0m in length. These colorful large catfishes have a brownish back, with yellow sides, and characteristic orange-red dorsal fin and caudal fin (hence the common name). Sometimes the dorsal, pelvic and anal fins are also red. They have a broad head with long whiskers, dark black body and white underneath that extends from the mouth to the caudal fin. It has a pair of barbels on the upper jaw, and two pairs on the lower jaw. Their whiskers are sensitive and have chemical reception cells which are used as the sense of smell. They breed using external fertilization after laying their eggs. They communicate by making a clicking sound to warn off potential dangers.[5] The redtail catfish is native to the Amazon, Orinoco, and Essequibo river basins of South America, in Ecuador, Venezuela, Guyana, Colombia, Peru, Suriname, Bolivia, and Brazil.[2] It is found only in fresh water, and inhabits larger rivers, streams, and lakes.[7][4] They eat during the evening and night and stay motionless during the day. They are bottom-dwellers and move about quite slowly. Red-tailed catfish are territorial fish.[5] Redtail catfish is also an invasive species in Malaysia; they are now found mostly in the Perak River and Pahang River.[citation needed] Due to the potential large size of this species, redtail catfish are considered a game fish by anglers. The current IGFA world record for weight belongs to the Brazilian Gilberto Fernandes with 56\u00a0kg (123\u00a0lb 7\u00a0oz).[8] It is said that the natives do not eat the meat of the redtail catfish because it is black in coloration.[9] In Thailand, it is an alien species that has been introduced by humans, like the common pleco, zebra tilapia, and alligator gar.[10]\nIn some places, it is feared because it has been believed to be the cause of the mysterious drownings of many of the passengers aboard the passenger ship Sobral Santos II when it sank. The redtail catfish is an extremely popular fish in Amazonian-themed exhibits at public aquaria, where they are often housed with other large fish, such as Colossoma macropomum or pacu, and other large catfish. Juveniles are often available as aquarium fish, despite their eventual large size. In an aquarium where they may be well-fed, these fish can grow quite rapidly,[9] and require tanks of at least 10,000\u00a0L (2,600\u00a0US\u00a0gal) when fully mature.[4] Weekly feeding is appropriate for this catfish; overfeeding is a common cause of death in this species.[11] It feeds heavily on live and dead fishes and other meat. Even as a juvenile of only a few inches in length, they are able to swallow many of the more common aquarium fish (such as tetras or guppies), and it is only appropriate to house this fish with other species of relatively large size. Redtail catfish also have a habit of swallowing inedible objects in the aquarium. Though these are often regurgitated, both the swallowing and the regurgitation can present a problem for the fish, and these objects are best kept out of the aquarium.[11] The redtail catfish has been hybridized with other fish, such as the Pseudoplatystoma or Tiger Shovelnose Catfish, through the use of hormones, in attempts to create a viable food fish: the Tiger Redtail Catfish. These hybrid fish sometimes make it into the aquarium hobby under a variety of common names.[11]"

Pictus catfish are sometimes mislabeled as Angelicus cats in the aquarium trade, but the latter name actually refers to an unrelated  African catfish, the mochokid Synodontis angelica.[1] Pimelodus pictus should not be confused with Leiarius pictus, a much larger (60\u00a0cm) pimelodid. Pimelodus pictus, like other members of the Pimelodidae, are known for having extremely long barbels. These can extend all the way to the caudal fin. The fish are silver-colored with black spots and stripes. They have sharp spines on their dorsal and pectoral fins, which makes shipping a difficult task, since the spines can pierce plastic bags and get caught in nets. There is relatively little sexual dimorphism, with females being slightly larger than males.[2] Like many catfish, P.\u00a0pictus has a downturned mouth and a forked tail.[3] These fish are active swimmers and, like many catfish, nocturnal bottom feeders.[1] Two forms are known; a large-spotted form and a small-spotted form. Of the two, only the large-spotted form is commonly seen in the aquarium trade; it does not grow as large as the small-spotted form.[3] In captivity, these fish prefer soft water and are omnivorous; pictus cats eat bloodworms, beef heart, insects, vegetables, and prepared fish foods. They will also eat very small fish such as neon tetras, depending on the size of the catfish. Despite this, they are generally non-aggressive and will not harm fish too large for them to eat. A larger tank is required as these fish are agile and fast swimmers. They are also non-territorial and can be kept with other P. pictus. Besides the mildly venomous sting imparted by the dorsal spine, they are generally harmless to humans. In the wild, Pimelodus pictus has an estimated average trophic level of 3.19.[4]"

They become sexually mature at 56\u00a0cm (22\u00a0in), males at 45\u00a0cm (18\u00a0in)[3] and this species reaches a maximum length of 90\u00a0cm (35\u00a0in) TL.[1] Fecundity seems to be estimated at 8 million eggs per kg,[4] but was recently measured in aquaculture at a lower, and more likely number of 150,000 eggs laid per kg.[3] According to Riehl and Haensch, five subspecies have been described:[5] However, Buitrago\u2013Su\u00e1rez and Burr place P. f. brevifile, P. f. intermedium, and P. f. nigricans, in the synonymy of P. punctifer. P. f. reticulatum is elevated as another distinct species P. reticulatum.[1] Previously, all subspecies except P. f. reticulatum were considered synonyms of P. fasciatum.[2] The species is of interest for aquaculture for food production (and indirectly as conservation measure because it may lower the fishing pressure on wild population), as well as for production of fish.\nMaturation in earthen tanks of fish caught in the wild is not problematic, since manipulation of fish during fishing and transportation is well done.\nReproduction may be obtained with two injections of Ovaprim\u00ae in 24 hours (10% and 90% of the recommended dosis, respectively), ovulation occurs after around 8 hr at 27\u00a0\u00b0C.[3] Incubation of eggs is carried out in \"Zug\" jars and hatching occurs 24 hours after fertilization at 26,5\u00a0\u00b0C. Vitelus resorption takes 3 days but larvae start feeding 2 days after hatching, and may start active cannibalism at this moment. Feeding may start 48 hours post-hatching with freshly hatched artemia nauplii, seven times a day. Larvae must be kept in the dark in order to maximize uniform distribution of larvae in the tanks and therefore food availability.[6] After 15 days, food may be completed and then replaced gradually with ground mammalian liver. After 20 days post hatching, fingerling may be fed high quality pelleted food adapted to their size.  This Pimelodidae-related article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it."

It is a brood parasite upon mouthbrooding cichlids.  This species grows to a length of 27.5 centimetres (10.8\u00a0in) TL.  This species is a minor component of local commercial fisheries.[2] Synodontis multipunctatus is one of a number of species of upside-down catfish in Lake Tanganyika, which is more famous for its cichlids. It gathers in large schools at depths of about 40 metres (130\u00a0ft) in the lake. S. multipunctatus is notable for its breeding behaviour - it is a brood parasite, similar to the cuckoo from which it takes its common name. Lake Tanganyika is home to a number of mouthbrooding cichlids, which care for their eggs and young by carrying them in their mouth. S. multipunctatus uses these, particularly Ctenochromis horei and Simochromis babaulti, as unwitting caretakers for their children. The smell of spawning cichlids excites S. multipunctatus into spawning, and as the cichlids lay their eggs the catfish will quickly slip in and eat the eggs before they can be collected by the mother. While doing so they also release and fertilise their own eggs. The female cichlid will hastily attempt to scoop up her eggs and, in doing so, will also collect eggs from S. multipunctatus. These eggs will then hatch inside the unwilling adoptive mother's mouth, and proceed to eat the cichlid eggs present before being released by the cichlid. This technique removes the burden of parental care from the S. multipunctatus, and allows them to breed again sooner. Synodontis multipunctatus are a popular addition to cichlid aquariums. They grow to about 15 centimetres (5.9\u00a0in), and can be bred in captivity provided suitable hosts are present. Some aquarists have had success with host cichlids from Lake Malawi and Lake Victoria as well as those from Lake Tanganyika.[3] They can be very aggressive and territorial towards other Synodontis species, they should be kept in groups over 3 to avoid competition between two, and proper cover and cave-like structures should be provided. They seem to be active in the day as much as the night and can prove quite lively. If kept in larger groups territorial issues are less likely.

        "description": " Synodontis petricola, known as the cuckoo catfish,[2] or the pygmy leopard catfish,[3] is a species of upside-down catfish endemic to Burundi, Zambia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Tanzania where it is only known from Lake Tanganyika.[2][4]  It was first described by Belgian ichthyologist Hubert Matthes in 1959.[4]  The species name \"petricola\" is derived from a combination of the Latin petra, meaning stone or rock, and the Latin cola, meaning inhabitant.  This refers to the rocky environment where this species is found.[3] Like all members of the genus Synodontis, S. petricola has a strong, bony head capsule that extends back as far as the first spine of the dorsal fin.[5] The head is about 3\u204410 of the standard length of the fish.[4] The head contains a distinct narrow, bony external protrusion called a humeral process.[3] The shape and size of the humeral process helps to identify the species. In S. petricola, the humeral process is triangular, rough, and is covered in many small, thin papillae.[4] The bottom edge has a poorly-defined ridge on the bottom edge, and the top edge is convex.[4] The humeral process ends in a sharp point.[4] It is about 1\u20442 of the length of the head.[4] The diameter of the eye is about 1\u20449 of the length of the head.[4] The fish has three pairs of barbels. The maxillary barbels are on located on the upper jaw, and two pairs of mandibular barbels are on the lower jaw. The maxillary barbel has a narrow membrane attached near the base and is straight without any branches.[4] It extends at least as far as the base of the pectoral spine, about 3\u20444 of the length of the head.[4] The outer pair of mandibular barbels extends just past the start of the pectoral girdle, about 1\u20442 of the length of the head,[4] and contains four to seven simple branches, usually without any secondary branches.[4] The inner pair of mandibular barbels is about 1\u20443 to 2\u20443 as long as the outer pair, about 1\u20444 of the length of the head,[4] with four to six branches, with many secondary branches present.[4] The skin of S. petricola has a large number of tiny vertical skin folds. The exact purpose of the skin folds is not known, but is a characteristic of the species of Syndontis that are endemic to Lake Tanganyika.[4] External granular papilla are present on the head, but not the body.[4] The front edges of the dorsal fins and the pectoral fins of Syntontis species are hardened into stiff spines.[3] In S. petricola, the spine of the dorsal fin is long, about 3\u20444 as long as the head,[4] is slightly curved, is smooth on the front and with fine serrations the back, and ends with short, white filament.[4] The remaining portion of the dorsal fin is made up of seven dark branching rays.[4] The spine of the pectoral fin is slightly curved, roughly as long as the dorsal fin spine, with large serrations on the back side.[4] The pectoral spine ends in short, white filament.[4] The rest of the pectoral fins are made up of eight to nine branching rays.[4] The adipose fin is large, does not contain any rays, and has a convex shape.[4] The pelvic fin contains one unbranched and six branched rays.[4] The front edge of the pelvic fin is vertically aligned midway between with the back edge of the dorsal fin and the front edge of the adipose fin.[4] The anal fin contains three to four unbranched and seven to nine branched rays; it is vertically aligned with the center of the adipose fin.[4] The tail, or caudal fin, is forked, with rounded lobes, and contains eight rays on the upper lobe, nine rays on the lower lobe.[4] The mouth of the fish faces downward and has wide lips that contain papilla.[4] All members of Syndontis have a structure called a premaxillary toothpad, which is located on the very front of the upper jaw of the mouth. This structure contains several rows of short, chisel-shaped teeth. In some species, this toothpad is made up of a large patch with several rows in a large cluster. In other species of Syndontis, this toothpad is clearly divided into two separate groups, separated by a thin band of skin that divides the toothpad.[4] This character is used as a method of differentiating between to different but similar species of Syndontis.[4] In S. petricola, the toothpad is interrupted, or clearly divided between the groups of teeth on the toothpad.[4] On the lower jaw, or mandible, the teeth of Syndontis are attached to flexible, stalk-like structures and described as \"s-shaped\" or \"hooked\".[3][5] The number of teeth on the mandible is used to differentiate between species; in S. petricola, there are 31 to 50 teeth on the mandible, arranged in a six short rows.[4] Some of the species of Synodontis have an opening or series of openings called the axillary pore. It is located on the side of the body below the humeral process and before the pectoral fin spine. The exact function of the port is not known to scientists, although its presence has been observed in seven other catfish genera. Fish in the genus Acrochordonichthys have been observed to secrete a mucus with toxic properties from their axillary pore, but there is no scientific consensus as to the exact purpose of the secretion or the pore.[4] S. petricola has a small axillary pore just below the humeral process.[4] The back of the fish is yellowish to copper-brown and is covered with large, irregularly-shaped black spots.[4]  In juveniles, these spots can appear larger and sometimes intersect.[4] The underside of the fish is lighter, with small, irregularly shaped spots.  Most of the species of Synodontis of Lake Tanganyika have a recognizable pattern consisting of dark triangles at the bases of all of the rayed fins, present in S. petricola, and the back edges of the fins are white in color.[4] The caudal fin has a black bar that runs from the base of each lobe to the top of the fin.[4] The barbels are white.[4] The maximum standard length of all known specimens is 11.5 centimetres (4.5\u00a0in) and a total length of 13.5 centimetres (5.3\u00a0in).[2][4] In general in Synodontis species, females tend to be slightly larger than males of the same age.[6] In the wild, the species is endemic to Lake Tanganyika, which has a temperature range of 23 to 26\u00a0\u00b0C (73 to 79\u00a0\u00b0F), and an approximate pH of 8.5 \u2013 9, and dH range of 4-15.[7] It inhabits rocky shorelines in the littoral zone, to a maximum depth of 30 metres (98\u00a0ft).[4] The reproductive habits of most of the species of Synodontis are not known, beyond some instances of obtaining egg counts from gravid females.[4] Spawning likely occurs during the flooding season between July and October, and pairs swim in unison during spawning.[8] Juveniles appear to be carnivorous, feeding on water mites, seed shrimp, and insect larvae. Adults feed on algae scraped from rocks as well as small invertebrates.[4] The growth rate is rapid in the first year, then slows down as the fish age.[6] The pygmy leopard catfish practices brood parasitism. It lives among rock piles frequented by various species of mauna: small African cichlids. Courtship behaviour culminates with the female sucking sperm from the male's cloaca. She brings the sperm through her digestive tract to her cloaca, where her eggs meet the sperm. She then rushes into the nest of a cichlid, devours the eggs, and deposits her own. The cichlids then raise the catfish as their own. Data related to Synodontis petricola at Wikispecies"

It was originally described in 1891 by Belgian ichthyologist Louise Schilthuis after its discovery in the Malebo Pool of the Congo River.[3]   The specific name \"angelicus\" means heavenly or divine, since juveniles of this species are remarkable for their bright coloring.[3] Adult specimens between 9 and 18 centimetres (3.5 and 7.1\u00a0in) are grey to dark violet, with reddish-yellow to bark brown-red blotches on the head, sides, adipose fin, and partly running together on the ventral surface.[3]   These blotches are evenly distributed and have sharp, distinct edges.[3]   The blotches may be edged with dark violet.  The fins are dark violet with brownish blotches and streaks.[3]   Juveniles between 4 and 9 centimetres (1.6 and 3.5\u00a0in) are strikingly colored, with white, round blotches on a red-violet background.[3] The first ray of the dorsal fin and the pectoral fins have a hardened first ray which is serrated.[2]   The caudal fin is deeply forked with an extension on the top lobe.[2][3]   It has short, cone-shaped teeth in the upper jaw.[2] In the lower jaw, the teeth are s-shaped and movable.[2] This species grows to a length of 25 centimetres (9.8\u00a0in) SL although specimens up to 55 centimetres (22\u00a0in) TL have been recorded in nature.[1] The species is commercially used as an aquarium species.[4]  The polka-dot African catfish is mostly nocturnal.[3] These catfish will excavate the substrate and may nibble plants. They eat smaller live foods and prepared foods. They prefer a water temperature of 24 to 28\u00a0\u00b0C (75 to 82\u00a0\u00b0F), a pH of 6.0\u20138.0 and a hardness of 5\u201319 dGH.[1] Data related to Synodontis angelicus at Wikispecies"

The type specimen is in the Mus\u00e9um National d' Histoire Naturelle de Paris.[4] Like all members of the genus Synodontis, S. nigrita has a strong, bony head capsule that extends back as far as the first spine of the dorsal fin.[5]  The head contains a distinct narrow, bony, external protrusion called a humeral process.[2] The shape and size of the humeral process helps to identify the species. In S. nigrita, the humeral process is as much longer than it is broad, with a ridge on the bottom edge, and with a pointed back end.[4] The fish has three pairs of barbels. The maxillary barbels are on located on the upper jaw, and two pairs of mandibular barbels are on the lower jaw. The maxillary barbel is long and straight without any branches, with a broad membrane at the base.[4] It extends to a length about 1 to 1+2\u20443 times the length of the head.[4] The outer pair of mandibular barbels is about twice the length of the inner pair, and both pairs have short, simple branches.[4] The front edges of the dorsal fins and the pectoral fins of Syntontis species are hardened into stiff spines.[2]  In S. nigrita, the spine of the dorsal fin is straight or slightly curved, 3\u20444 to 1 times the length of the head, smooth in the front and serrated on the back.[4] The remaining portion of the dorsal fin is made up of seven branching rays.[4] The spine of the pectoral fin about the same size as the dorsal spine, and serrated on both sides.[4] The adipose fin is 2+2\u20443 to 3 times as long as it is deep.[4] The anal fin contains four unbranched and eight to nine branched rays.[4] The tail, or caudal fin, is deeply forked, with the upper lobe slightly longer.[4] All members of Syndontis have a structure called a premaxillary toothpad, which is located on the very front of the upper jaw of the mouth. This structure contains several rows of short, chisel-shaped teeth.  In S. nigrita, the toothpad forms a short and broad band.[4]   On the lower jaw, or mandible, the teeth of Syndontis are attached to flexible, stalk-like structures and described as \"s-shaped\" or \"hooked\".[2][5] The number of teeth on the mandible is used to differentiate between species; in S. nigrita, there are about 30 to 35 teeth on the mandible.[4] The body color is brown or olive to blackish, with round black spots likely.  The fins are greyish to blackish; the caudal fin has black spots or black cross bars.  Juveniles are brown, with black spots.[4] The maximum total length of the species is 33.5 centimetres (13.2\u00a0in).[3]  Generally, females in the genus Synodontis tend to be slightly larger than males of the same age.[6] In the wild, the species has been found throughout northern Africa.  In central Africa, it has been recorded in the Ubangui River basin and the central Congo River basin.  In eastern Africa, it is found in Lake Albert and possibly Lake Kyoga.  In northern Africa, it is possibly present in Egypt.  In northeast Africa, it occurs in the White Nile from Khartoum into the Jebel and Ghazal River systems, as well as the Baro River.  In western Africa, the species is known from the Chad River basin, the Niger River basin, the Volta River, the Senegal River, the Gambia River, the Geba River, the Oueme River, and the Casamance River.[1]  The reproductive habits of most of the species of Synodontis are not known, beyond some instances of obtaining egg counts from gravid females.[7] Spawning likely occurs during the flooding season between July and October, and pairs swim in unison during spawning.[8]   As a whole, species of Synodontis are omnivores, consuming insect larvae, algae, gastropods, bivalves, sponges, crustaceans, and the eggs of other fishes.[7]  The growth rate is rapid in the first year, then slows down as the fish age.[6] Data related to Synodontis nigrita at Wikispecies"

These fish are adapted to spend most of their time upside-down. This is reflected in the fish's pigmentation \u2013 their bellies are darker than their backs, a form of countershading.[3] These fish have lighter colors on the top of their bodies and darker colors below used for camouflage. The lighter colors on the top of them make it harder for predators to see the fish when looking up toward the sky but only when the fish are swimming upside-down.[4] Synodontis nigriventris are mostly nocturnal, and feed on insects, crustaceans, and plant matter.[2] These fish lay eggs.[2] The young fish do not swim upside-down until they are about two months old.[5] Adults swim and rest upside down in the water. They swim faster when upside down, and are more likely to be upside down around objects or at the water bottom. The more objects around the fish, the more they tend to swim upside down.[4] When close to an object, the fish puts its ventral side closest to the object.[4] It rarely swims in the middle of the water, preferring to swim either at the bottom or at the surface.[6] By swimming upside down when it feeds,[7] it can readily catch prey at the surface from beneath.[4] The blotched upside-down catfish is well suited to aquariums because of its small size (typically 9 or 10\u00a0cm or less) and peaceful demeanor.[3] Data related to Synodontis nigriventris at Wikispecies"

The giraffe catfish is found throughout Africa in lakes and rivers, partially due to introduction and establishment in other areas.[2] It is found in many important lakes and rivers such as the Nile and Lake Chad. Its distribution covers includes bodies of water from East Africa to West Africa. It generally lives in shallow waters with muddy bottoms.[1] This fish has a maximum size that sources say are between two and three feet. The giraffe-like pattern will fade with age to a two-tone mottled brown. Various subspecies have been described for this fish, indicating some geographical variation in coloration.[2] Eggs are scattered in a nest and guarded by the male. Dinotopterus cunningtoni takes advantage of the care and allows the male giraffe catfish to care for its eggs and young, an example of interspecific brood care.[1] The giraffe catfish is occasionally imported for the aquarium trade. Because of its large eventual size and its fast rate of growth, it is inappropriate for smaller aquaria. This fish will readily accept a variety of foods and is tolerant of a wide variety of water conditions. They will scavenge the aquarium looking for food, which could cause in the uprooting of plants.[2] This fish is also an important food fish in Africa.[2]"

It uses its power to defend itself and to capture prey. In Africa, it occurs in the Nile and tropical Africa (exclusive of Lake Victoria), Lake Turkana, Lake Chad and Senegal basins. Occurs among rock favors standing water. Active at night, feeding mainly on fish stunned by electric shocks. The electric organ, capable of discharging 300-400 V, is derived from pectoral muscle and surrounds almost the entire body. It is used both for prey capture and defense. This is an Old World catfish. It is reputed that Doctors in ancient Egypt used shocks from the Electric Catfish to reduce the pain of arthritis. This trait is still used today in some areas. It also has the earliest reference of them as hieroglyphics on the walls of ancient Egyptian tombs some 5,000 years ago.[citation needed] Malapterurus electricus is eaten as food in parts of Africa. Being a food fish, M. electricus is also encountered in the pet trade as an aquarium fish. The electric organs of Malapterurus have been used in studies of neuronal metabolism, axonal transport. In their natural habitat they form pairs and lay their eggs in excavated cavities or holes. The male takes the eggs into his mouth. There have been rumours that they are mouth brooders. It is also unknown how the fry is immune to the electric shocks by the parents. Malapterurus electricus is sometimes encountered in aquarium supply stores. It can reach a maximum length of over 1 meter (3\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in) in the wild, but has an average size of 12 inches (30\u00a0cm) in the aquarium. It is quite hardy and greedily accepts most foods, although some experimentation may be required to find the best food. The only other animals that are compatible with this species are snails, which they will ignore. A minimum aquarium size of 55 US gallons (210\u00a0L; 46\u00a0imp\u00a0gal) is required, with bogwood or pieces of PVC pipe. They are active burrowers and will often remove the gravel from under their favorite hiding spot. A minimum temperature of 75\u00a0\u00b0F (24\u00a0\u00b0C) is necessary.[citation needed] It is illegal to possess any species of electric catfish for personal or commercial use in Florida.[2]"

It is commonly seen in the freshwater aquarium trade, but its taxonomy is confusing and was only fully resolved in 2013.[1] It is endemic to Thailand, and found in rivers south of the Isthmus of Kra that drain into the Gulf of Thailand and river basins in the Cardamom Mountains.[1]  There are also unconfirmed reports from Penang in Malaysia.[2] Until 1989, it was considered to be the same as the \"glass catfish\" Kryptopterus bicirrhis, a larger species infrequently seen in the aquarium trade.[1] Subsequently, the ghost catfish commonly seen in the aquarium trade was believed to be the same as K. minor, but in 2013 it was established that the aquarium specimens actually represented another species, which was described as K. vitreolus.[1] The true K. minor, which is restricted to Borneo, has rarely (if ever) entered the aquarium trade.[1] This is a transparent freshwater catfish with two long barbels. Standard lengths may range up to 8\u00a0cm (3.1\u00a0in), but usually only reach around 6.5\u00a0cm (2.6\u00a0in) in total length.[1] They are transparent because, like all catfish, they are scaleless, and catfish within the genus Kryptopterus lack body pigment. Most of their organs are located near the head; with a magnifying glass, their heart can be seen beating. When the light strikes the fish just right, it can create an iridescent rainbow color. During strong illness and after death, they turn milky white. The scientific species name vitreolus is derived from the Latin vitreus, which means glass.[1] Among described species of Kryptopterus, only two other species, K. minor and K. piperatus, have clearly transparent bodies and both these are largely \u2013 if not entirely \u2013 absent from the aquarium trade.[1] The body of others, including K. bicirrhis, are only somewhat translucent or opaque.[1] The aquarium trade in K. vitreolus generally relies on wild-caught specimens, and there are concerns that this may be unsustainable due to the volume and its limited range.[1] Unlike many other aquarium fish, it is not known to be bred at commercial facilities.[1] K. vitreolus reacts to electromagnetic fields owing to a protein encoded by Electromagnetic Perceptive Gene (EPG).[3]"

        "description": " Wallagonia leerii, also known as the Great Tapah, helicopter catfish, and formerly the striped wallago catfish is a species of catfish native to Southeast Asia. Its habitat ranges from the river drainages of Thailand through the Malayan peninsula to the islands of Sumatra and Borneo in Indonesia.[1] It can grow up to 2\u00a0m (6\u00a0ft 7\u00a0in) in length and weigh up to 150\u00a0kg (330\u00a0lb).[1] It has been used as food in Southeast Asia since ancient times.[2] Overfishing for its prized meat has caused the population to significantly decrease. Furthermore, the breeding migration pattern of this fish is especially vulnerable to damming, which has also decreased the wild population significantly. Until osteological research validated the genus Wallagonia in 2014, W. leerii was included in the genus Wallago.[1] The other two species of the genus Wallagonia, the Lesser tapah from the Mekong river basin and the Spotted tapah from the Kinabatangan river basin on Borneo, are currently considered as distinct species. There are, however, strong suspicions that these may in fact be subspecies of W. leerii, as the sole difference seems to lie in a slightly different coloration.[1] The Great Tapah is a large fish, commonly attaining lengths of 150 centimetres and a mass of up to 86 kilograms. The size of this fish however can easily exceed the aforementioned lengths.[3]  It is the second-largest catfish in its family and is only outsized by the wels, Giant pangasius and Mekong giant catfish. It has a short, rounded body and a long broad tail, the anal fin of the fish is about as long as the tail itself and it ends in a forked caudal fin. The pelvic fins of the fish are small, and there are no dorsal spines on it. The Great Tapah possesses a noticeable hump, atop sits its dorsal fin, which is small and almost elliptical. The head of this fish is long, and remarkably wide with a huge lower jaw that extends beyond its maxilla. The mouth of the catfish is inlaid with several rows of sharp teeth that enable it to grip prey. It is a piscivore, primarily feeding on small fish which are snatched mid-swimming and consumed whole. The Great Tapah faces a multitude of threats, as it is vulnerable to destructive fishing, competition with invasive species, destruction of suitable habitat, and dam construction that impact its lifecycle.[4] Splitting of species within the complex may give doubts to the true abundance of the species, meaning it could be far more restricted than once thought. In July, adults migrate downstream to flooded grasslands to spawn. At night, the eggs are spawned near the surface.[5]  This catfish-related article is a stub.

        "description": " The walking catfish  (Clarias batrachus) is a species of freshwater airbreathing catfish native to Southeast Asia. It is named for its ability to \"walk\" and wiggle across dry land, to find food or suitable environments. While it does not truly walk as most bipeds or quadrupeds do, it can use its pectoral fins to keep it upright as it makes a wiggling motion with snakelike movements to traverse land.[2] This fish normally lives in slow-moving and often stagnant waters in ponds, swamps, streams, and rivers, as well as in flooded rice paddies, or temporary pools that may dry up. When this happens, its \"walking\" skill allows the fish to move to other aquatic environments. Considerable taxonomic confusion surrounds this species and it has frequently been confused with other close relatives.[3][4] One main distinction between the walking catfish and the native North American ictalurid catfish with which it sometimes is confused, is that the walking catfish lacks an adipose fin.[5] It can survive 18 hours out of water. [6] The walking catfish has an elongated body shape and reaches almost 0.5\u00a0m (1.6\u00a0ft) in length and 1.2\u00a0kg (2.6\u00a0lb) in weight.[3] Often covered laterally in small white spots, the body is mainly coloured a gray or grayish brown.[5] This catfish has long-based dorsal and anal fins,[5] as well as several pairs of sensory barbels. The skin is scaleless, but covered with mucus, which protects the fish when it is out of water. This fish needs to be handled carefully when fishing it due to its embedded sting or thorn-like defensive mechanism hidden behind its fins (including the middle ones before the tail fin, similar to the majority of all catfishes). The walking catfish is a tropical species native to maritime Southeast Asia. The native range of true Clarias batrachus is confirmed only from the Indonesian island of Java, but three closely related and more widespread species frequently have often been confused with this species. These are C. magur of northeast India and Bangladesh, a likely undescribed species from Indochina, and another likely undescribed species from the Thai-Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, and Borneo.[3][4] Both of these undescribed species have been referred to as, Clarias aff. batrachus.[3] At present, the taxonomic position of the Philippines population (called hito or simply \"catfish\" by the locals) is unclear, and it also is unclear whether South Indian populations are C. magur or another species.[4] As a consequence, much information (behavioral, ecological, related to introduced populations, etc.) listed for C. batrachus, may be for the closely related species that have been confused with true C. batrachus.[4] True C. batrachus, C. magur and the two likely undescribed species are all kept in aquaculture.[4] Walking catfish thrive in stagnant, frequently hypoxic waters,[5] and often are found in muddy ponds, canals, ditches, and similar habitats. The species spends most of its time on, or right above, the bottom, with occasional trips to the surface to gulp air.[5] In the wild, this creature is omnivorous; it feeds on smaller fish, molluscs, and other invertebrates, as well as detritus and aquatic weeds. It is a voracious eater that consumes food supplies rapidly, so it is considered harmful when invasive.[7] Within Asia, this species has been introduced widely.[3] It has also been introduced outside its native range where it is considered an invasive species. It consumes the food supplies of native fish and preys on their young. It also is regarded as an invasive species because they can destroy fish farms. In the United States, it is established in Florida.[8] It is reported in California, Connecticut, Georgia, Massachusetts, and Nevada.  \nThe walking catfish was imported to Florida, reportedly from Thailand, in the early 1960s for the aquaculture trade.[5] The first introductions apparently occurred in the mid-1960s when adult fish imported as brood stock escaped, either from a fish farm in northeastern Broward County or from a truck transporting brood fish between Dade and Broward Counties. Additional introductions in Florida, supposedly purposeful releases, were made by fish farmers in the Tampa Bay area, Hillsborough County in late 1967 or early 1968, after the state banned the importation and possession of walking catfish. Aquarium releases likely are responsible for introductions in other states. Dill and Cordone (1997) reported this species has been sold by tropical fish dealers in California for some time. They also have been spotted occasionally in the Midwest. In Florida, walking catfish are known to have invaded aquaculture farms, entering ponds where they prey on agricultural fish stocks. In response, fish farmers have had to erect fences to protect ponds. Authorities have also created laws that ban possession of walking catfish. In 2017, Clarias spp. were recovered from the River Tonge, near Bolton, Northern England.[9] In Indonesia, it is commonly referred as lele, or when needing distinction; lele jawa or lele kampung, compared to lele dumbo or lele sangkuriang which refers to the introduced C. gariepinus. It is the main ingredient in several traditional dishes, such as pecel lele and mangut lele. In Thailand, Clarias aff. batrachus is known as pla duk dan (Thai: \u0e1b\u0e25\u0e32\u0e14\u0e38\u0e01\u0e14\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19). It is a common, inexpensive food item, prepared in a variety of ways. It often is offered by street vendors, especially grilled or fried.[10] This fish is also one of the most common freshwater catfish in the Philippines, which as aforementioned is known as hito in the local language. Despite this, current evidence of Clarias aff. batrachus populations from other regions of southeast Asia and India in relation towards C. batrachus have not been thoroughly studied.[clarification needed] A white variation with black patterns is commonly seen in the aquarium fish trade. However, this color variation also is prohibited where walking catfish are banned. Very well-rooted plants and large structures that provide some shade should be included in an aquarium with these fish. Any small tankmates will be eaten by this fish."

H. brachysoma is found in smooth flowing areas with much vegetation. Periyar river in Kerala state is the best habitat but now they are commonly seen in the Chalakudy River due to the less disturbed habitats. The population genetic structure of this species has been studied extensively by using genetic markers.[9][10]  This species occupies lowland areas of rivers and backwaters with mud or sand substrate. It has also been recorded in deep pools and hill streams.[2]\nThe diet of H. brachysoma has been studied. It is an unspecialized feeder and eats a variety of meaty foods. Food items include crustaceans, molluscs, and fish. Adults may consume terrestrial insects and even frogs. Stomachs of these fish contain detritus which is indicative of its bottom-feeding habits.[3] This flexible diet is beneficial in its variable habitat, in which food availality is affected by monsoons.[3]  Feeding rate is known to increase during the breeding season in the months following the monsoon season.[3] Spawning occurs before the monsoons and finishes by the southwest monsoon in the summer.[2] H. brachysoma is an important food fish in India and is also sold in the aquarium trade. The IUCN considers H. brachysoma to be a vulnerable species, while other have considered it to be an endangered species.[11] Overexploitation, habitat alteration, pollution and related anthropogenic pressures on their natural habitats have considerably reduced populations of this species by 60\u201370% during the last few years.[3]"

        "description": " Helicophagus hypophthalmus Sauvage, 1878\nPangasius sutchi Fowler, 1937[3]\nPangasius hypophthalmus (Sauvage, 1878) The iridescent shark, iridescent shark catfish[4] (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus) is a species of shark catfish (family Pangasiidae) native to the rivers of Southeast Asia. Despite its name, it is not a shark. It is found in the Mekong basin as well as the Chao Phraya River, and is heavily cultivated for food there. The meat is often marketed under the common name swai (from Thai \u0e2a\u0e27\u0e32\u0e22). It has also been introduced into other river basins as a food source, and its striking appearance and iridescence have made it popular with fishkeeping hobbyists, among whom it is also known as the Siamese shark catfish or sutchi catfish.[5] The swai's omnivorous diet consists of crustaceans, other fish, and plant matter.[6] The fish is named for the glow or iridescence exhibited in juveniles, as well as the shark-like appearance of this and other shark catfish. Adults reach up to 130\u00a0cm (4.3\u00a0ft) in length and can weigh up to a maximum of 44\u00a0kg (97\u00a0lb). They have a shiny, iridescent color that gives these fish their name. However, large adults are uniformly grey. The fins are dark grey or black. Juveniles have a black stripe along the lateral line and a second black stripe below the lateral line.[6] Iridescent sharks originate from the large rivers Chao Phraya and Mekong in Asia, though they have been introduced into other rivers for aquaculture. They are a freshwater fish that natively live in a tropical climate and prefer water with a 6.5\u20137.5 pH, a water hardness of 2.0\u201329 dGH, and a temperature range of 22\u201326\u00a0\u00b0C (72\u201379\u00a0\u00b0F).[6] They can tolerate hypoxic conditions thanks to their swim bladder which can be used as an air-breathing organ.[7] They prefer large bodies of water similar to the deep waters of their native Mekong river basin. The iridescent shark is a migratory fish that in most regions moves upstream to spawn during the flood season while the waters are high and returns downstream to seek rearing habitats when the river water levels recede. The dates of the migrations vary depending on the river system. In the Mekong river basin, they migrate upstream in May to July and return downstream during September through December. South of the Khone Falls, upstream migration occurs in October to February, with its peak in November to December; here, it appears to be triggered by receding waters at the end of the flood season.[6] In August 2015, an environmental group in Santander, Colombia, confirmed that iridescent sharks had been found in one of the tributaries that feed into the Magdalena River, having been accidentally introduced from illegal farm fisheries in the area. The find has caused alarm amongst the scientific community and government officials, as the Magdalena river is home to over 200 native fish species, 35 of which are endangered.[8] Disruption to these sharks can come from many physical stressors, including but not limited to shear forces, rapid decompression, blade strike and turbulence. These can lead to and have led to an increase in the Injury and mortality rate of these sharks. This is a sad reality[citation needed] since these injured can be caused by hydropower developments which are being put into place to combat the global climate crisis that is being faced.[9]\nIridescent sharks are also introduced to other Southeast Asia countries for food, especially Peninsular Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and Myanmar. In Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia they are called ikan patin (which 'ikan' means fish in Malay and Indonesian), Malaysian Chinese prefer them steamed or cooked in whole, while Malay prefer cooking these fishes with Tempoyak and curry.[10] Pangasius does not have a gourmet reputation and is sold cheaply as swai (/swa\u026a/, from Thai \u0e2a\u0e27\u0e32\u0e22 s\u0304w\u0101y)[11][12] in the United States, panga (or pangas) in Europe and cream dory and basa in several Asian countries and in Australia and the UK. Despite its lowly reputation, the total export of pangasius from Vietnam reached US$1.8 billion in 2014.[13] Pangasius fillets are an increasingly popular product because of their low cost, mild taste and firm texture. Recipes for other whitefish such as sole or halibut can be adapted to pangasius.[14] Pangasius is an omnivorous fish, and thus does not require a high level of animal protein in its diet. Typical grading sizes are 3\u20135\u00a0oz (85\u2013140\u00a0g), 5\u20137\u00a0oz (140\u2013200\u00a0g), and 7\u20139\u00a0oz (200\u2013260\u00a0g).[15] While juvenile iridescent sharks are sold as pets for home aquariums, they are not easy fish to keep. Iridescent sharks are schooling fish that prefer groups,[6] are accustomed to living in rivers, and are active fish that require space. They have very poor eyesight, so detected movement from outside of their habitat can be seen as a threat. If stressed, their first instinct is to flee; a blind dash can cause injury in an aquarium environment. These injuries may result in the fish sinking to the bottom, where it may lie on its side or back until it recovers.[16] Iridescent sharks require a minimum tank size of 12\u00a0m (39\u00a0ft) to develop naturally. Schools require even larger tanks. If given enough room and fed adequately, they can reach 1\u00a0m (3.3\u00a0ft) in length. In most home aquaria, the lack of space stunts their growth. For this reason, most iridescent sharks kept in home aquaria grow to  15 to 30\u00a0cm (6 to 12\u00a0in) in length only and may die prematurely. When provided adequately sized aquaria and proper husbandry, iridescent sharks may live into their teens and grow to full size.[17]"

Its populations have declined drastically, mainly due to overfishing, and it is now considered Critically Endangered.[1] The specific name sanitwongsei was chosen to honor M. R. Suwaphan Sanitwong (Thai: \u0e21.\u0e23.\u0e27.\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e27\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e23\u0e13 \u0e2a\u0e19\u0e34\u0e17\u0e27\u0e07\u0e28\u0e4c) for his support of fisheries in Thailand.[2] The species is native to the Mekong and Chao Phraya rivers that run through China, Cambodia, Thailand, Viet Nam, and the Lao People's Democratic Republic. It has been introduced to central Anatolia,[3] South Africa,[4] and Malaysia.[5] The Pangasius sanitwongsei is tolerant of poor quality water,[4] mainly in brackish waters, and prefers to live in the bottom of deep depressions in freshwater rivers.[6][failed verification] The fish live in rivers but are experiencing endangerment due to dams being built, causing the fish to be trapped and unable to migrate.[7] There are currently two sub-populations of Paroon Shark separated by the Khone Falls which they do not migrate over.[8] The Giant Pangasius is a ray-finned fish part of the family Pangasiidae commonly known as Shark Catfishes. They are recognized for having both dorsal and ventral long fins, which help stabilize the fish and keep it upright.[9] This adds to their bilateral symmetry corresponding to their developed swimming ability. Its skin is pigmented with dusky melanophores that help with camouflage in bottom waters. It has a wide, flat, whiskerless head. Its body is compressed and elongate, with a depressed head.[10] It has a continuous and uninterrupted single vomero-palatine teeth patch which is curved.[11] The anal fin has 26 rays and the pectoral spine is similar in size to the dorsal spine and also shows serrations.[10] It has a silver, curved underside and a dark brown back.  Its dorsal, pectoral and pelvic fins are dark gray and the first soft ray is extended into a filament. Its dorsal, adipose, pectoral, and caudal fins are a dark grey to black coloring, with its anal fin and pelvic fins a white to grey coloring.[4] Full-grown adults can reach 300 centimetres (9.8\u00a0ft) SL in length and weigh up to 300\u00a0kg (660\u00a0lb).[12] More commonly the fish's length is around 2 meters.[6] Little is known of the reproduction of P. sanitwongsei, but the time of spawning happens in the months of April and May.[6] It is predicted that spawning happens in the rivers where they are found; they are not believed to be migrating from outside the river when getting ready to spawn.[13] Eggs and sperm are usually released in a muddier area to prevent eggs from sticking to each other.[14] The number of eggs per each spawning is around 600 (with a diameter of 2-2.5mm) and the brood shows low genetic variation.[6] There is no parental care after spawning.[15] The giant pangasius is a benthopelagic and migratory species. Juveniles and adults feed on crustaceans and fishes. These fish typically spawn just prior to the monsoon season.[12] It is believed that the P. sanitwongsei prey on shrimp, crabs, and fish and hideout in deep areas in rivers.[6] The P. sanitwongsei have a seasonal migration but the fish does not leave the river during its migration, it only stays within the river during the seasonal migration.[16] The P. sanitwongsei is a carnivorous fish, whose prey consist of shrimp, crabs, and fish.[6] Since the fish lives on the bottom, it is also known to feed on larger animals' carcasses.[4] Due to it being both an apex predator and a bottom-dwelling fish, it limits the populations of smaller fish as many catfish species. This fish's lifespan isn't known, but it is known that it grows fast[4] and usually the trend is when it grows fast, it dies quickly.[citation needed] The possible reasoning for this could be the fact that there is over-fishing of the species.[3] The P. sanitwongsei's role in the ecosystem is the top predator, therefore inflicts top down control on the population. Top predators aid in the limitation of smaller organisms and in this case they prey on smaller fish keeping the smaller fish in check. Without these carnivorous predators, the smaller fish could overpopulate and throw the food chain into imbalance.[17]  Due to overharvesting, the native fish population may increase since the P. sanitwongsei population is declining.[18] This fish is important to many locals that reside in the regions where the rivers run through as this is an important food source. Many fishing villages rely on the organisms that reside in the river to provide food for their family as well as a source of income as they can sell them at markets. Due to this fish's large known range, it can show us migratory pathways and spawning habits and areas that should be protected, and other areas that can be harvested.[6] This species of fish is also important to fisheries as it can grow to large sizes, even in captivity, and build an economy that relies heavily on fish and other water species. This was a significant reason why it was introduced to rivers in South Africa.[4] These fishes are also valuable asset in the pet trade. They are considered exotic organisms as they are not commonly found in aquariums and are not domesticated. This introduced species in South African rivers can also be a case of release from aquariums once they could no longer be contained due to their high energy need and large size.[4] Fishing of this species used to be accompanied by religious ceremonies and rites. It is often mentioned in textbooks, news media, and popular press. This fish is a popular food fish and marketed fresh.[12] They were introduced to Malaysia for both food and as an ornamental fish. These fish sometimes appear in the aquarium fish hobby. Most specimens do not reach their full size without an extremely large aquarium or pond. There is even a \"balloon\" form of this fish where the fish has an unusually short and stocky body.[19] In addition to fishing for religious purposes, they are also hunted for sport as they are the largest of their kind. They are considered trophy fish and are hunted for prestige and fame. The downside is that these individuals are the most fecund and mature which leads to a decrease in population if too many are harvested at one time. This further makes them a topic of conservation as they play key roles in their ecosystem.[20] This fish is highly protected and has a high conservation value and is banned from being fished through all seasons.[21] The fish is being threatened by overharvesting, damming of rivers, and pollution. Their population continues to decline as there are not many legislations and enforcement toward this species. A common threat to these large organisms is dams and segmentation of the Mekong River. The Paroon shark travels upstream to spawn and resides downstream. The construction of dams leads to segmentation of the natural habitat.[22] Even though the bodies of water are interconnected these fish are not capable of swimming through walls to get to their natural breeding sites. Aside from being threatened by anthropogenic causes, the Giant Pangasius is considered an umbrella species in conservation. Protecting this species would provide protection for species that inhabit the same region. With this tactic, a whole ecosystem can be preserved. Due to this area being an area that is highly fished commercially and locally, certain regulations can be put in place to manage the size of the fish that can be caught allowing mature adults to reproduce with greater success. [23] A known breeding practice, to try and help the population, is being practiced by the Thai government.[6] A halt on harvesting has been recommended until the P. sanitwongsei's population can rise to a safe level.[6] Even though these fish are grown in a safe fishery, this can reduce the genetic diversity between them making them more susceptible to disease as well as environmental stress. To control the amount of overharvesting (via fishing) that occurs certain size and catch limits can be put in place. In 1989, the Paroon shark was listed as a class II protected species by the government of Yunnan, China.[8] The issue is that the habitat of this species lies in multiple countries' domains including Cambodia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Thailand, and Viet Nam. Restrictions in parts of the river that reside in China's territory, leave the other parts to be unprotected. There are some groups in the Asian continent who have been trying to protect and conserve the wildlife in these regions including the Asian Species Action Partnership (ASAP), Species Survival Commission (SSC), World Wildlife Fund (WWF), and International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN).[24]"

It may also be called Southern striped Raphael, talking catfish, chocolate doradid, chocolate catfish or thorny catfish.[1] It is native to the Amazon, Paraguay\u2013Paran\u00e1 and lower Orinoco basins in South America.[2] This peaceful, nocturnal species is a popular aquarium fish due to its pleasant temperament and curious nature.[3] Despite its name \"talking catfish\", it does not speak. This catfish has long been confused with Platydoras costatus of Suriname and French Guiana, where the pale stripe on the body does not extend onto the head.[2] These fish burrow in the soft river bottoms and frequently occurs on sandy bottoms.[4] These fish feed on mollusks, crustaceans and organic debris.[4] They have rigid pectoral fin spines. The striped Raphael catfish also has tiny and curved protective spines running along its body. The typically reported maximum standard length of this species is 20\u201324\u00a0cm (7.9\u20139.4\u00a0in).[5][6] Considerably larger individuals, up to 43\u00a0cm (17\u00a0in) long, have been reported from the Tocantins\u2013Araguaia basin,[4][7] but this population, together with those from the Tapaj\u00f3s and Xingu, likely represent an undescribed species (not to be confused with P. birindellii, a species from the Xingu basin that was described in 2018).[2][8] Juvenile striped raphael catfish have been recorded cleaning piscivorous fish such as Hoplias cf. malabaricus. The stripe pattern in the young may serve as a signal that allows for its recognition as a cleaner. It is noted that the striping pattern is not as strong in adults, and so the cleaning behavior is probably only seen in juveniles.[9] The striped Raphael catfish is a fine and sociable community fish that are peaceful to fellow catfishes and other fish species.[3] However, they are nocturnal, and are usually not visible during the day.[3] It is best not to catch the striped Raphael catfish with a fish net because they are prone to sticking out their pectoral fin spines in a very rigid manner, especially if stressed. Untangling these spines from a net is difficult and dangerous to both handler and fish. Alternative methods should be used.\nAlthough known as a spawning fish, sexual differences are unknown and there have been no reports of being successfully bred in captivity.[3] Because of this, these fish must be wild-caught, and therefore related species of similar appearance sometimes appear in the hobby, such as Orinocodoras eigenmanni, which differs in a longer snout.[3]\nThe Raphael catfish will make some grunting/squeaking noises while out of water.\nAlthough generally sociable with other fish, sometimes this fish can feed on smaller fish so take care when introducing one to an established tank."

It is native to the Rio Negro and Orinoco  basins in Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela,[1][2] where mostly found in slow-moving waters with many submerged structures.[3] It is currently the only recognized species of the genus Asterophysus,[4] but a specimen that possibly represents an undescribed species has been collected in Maraj\u00f3 (about 1,200\u00a0km or 750\u00a0mi from the traditionally recognized range of A. batrachus).[5] The gulper catfish grows to a standard length of 25\u00a0cm (9.8\u00a0in),[1] and a total length of 28.5\u00a0cm (11.2\u00a0in).[6] It has a short, thick-set shape and is dark-colored with a whitish belly.[6] People in its native range typically will not eat it because they consider it very ugly,[7] but it is sometimes kept in aquariums.[8] The gulper catfish is a strict carnivore and swallows its prey, mostly other fish, whole. This prey can be exceptionally large for its size, sometimes even larger than the gulper catfish itself,[8] although such feeding attempts can be unsuccessful.[3] The catfish catches prey by biting on the head. Escaping out of the mouth is generally prevented by the fine, backwards-pointing teeth of the catfish. Instead the struggles of the prey cause it to be further engulfed and eventually ending up folded (with both its head and tail pointing towards the predator's head) in the greatly extendable gulper catfish stomach.[6][9] The fully extended stomach may result in an abnormal appearance of the gulper catfish to the point where its swimming can be impaired. It may also swallow large amounts of water only to expel it later along with remains of earlier prey.[6] Potential prey fish are apparently unable to recognize the gulper catfish as dangerous because fish will not generally consider other fish of roughly similar size as a major threat, and because of its slow, unobtrusive approach.[6][9] A common observed attack is the catfish quickly turning to the side and biting on the head of the targeted fish. Even if the first attempt fails, the gulper catfish will not try to pursue it. The prey will typically still not realize that the catfish represents a threat and can be caught using the same approach.[6] Another method of catching prey was observed by a snorkeler in the Atabapo River. Here the gulper catfish live in crevices between rocks and dart out to catch passing prey such as angelfish.[10] In aquariums gulper catfish will feed during both day and night, but it is suspected the species is nocturnal and crepuscular in the wild, giving it an additional advantage when hunting along river banks for its often sleeping prey.[6]"

        "description": " The emerald catfish  (Corydoras splendens) is a tropical freshwater fish belonging to the Corydoradinae sub-family of the family Callichthyidae native to the Amazon Basin in South America.[1] It has traditionally been known as Brochis splendens.[2] The fish has appeared on a stamp in Brazil.[3] It was originally described as Callichthys splendens by Fran\u00e7ois Louis de la Porte, comte de Castelnau in 1855.  This species was once also commonly called Brochis coeruleus. W. A. Gosline was the first to suspect that the two species were the same in 1940, but it was actually Njiseen & Isbr\u00fccker, in 1970, who combined the two, giving sufficient reasons for doing so. The species would be described as Brochis splendens, until most of the catfish formerly classified as Brochis were re-classified into Corydoras.[2] The current recognized classification is thus Corydoras splendens.[1] It is native to the upper reaches Amazon Basin.[1] This includes Ucayali River to Pucallpa, Ambiyacu River, and the area around Iquitos in western Brazil, southeastern Colombia, eastern Ecuador and eastern Peru. Depending upon the angle of lighting, the fish's body reflects a metallic green, blue-green, or even a bluish color.  The ventral area is yellowish with the pectoral, ventral, and anal fins yellowish and the dorsal, caudal, and adipose fins a translucent brownish.  The females are larger and more robust than the males, and have a more pinkish belly as opposed to the more yellowish one for the males. This fish can be distinguished from the green/bronze corydoras catfish by its usually larger size, stouter body, and more pointed snout. The fish inhabits sluggish waters with dense vegetation along the banks.[1] It occurs in shallow muddy waters and will grow in length up to 7.5\u00a0centimetres (3\u00a0in).[1] It lives in a tropical climate in water with a 5.8\u20138.0 pH, a water hardness of 2\u201330 dGH, and a temperature range of 22\u201328\u00a0\u00b0C (72\u201382\u00a0\u00b0F).[1] It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, and insect larvae. It lays eggs in dense vegetation and adults do not guard the eggs. The emerald catfish is a common species in freshwater aquaria.  It is a peaceful, undemanding species and can be maintained under the same conditions as most Corydoras species.  They are shy and easily frightened when kept as individuals, so it is best kept in small groups of at least three, with more being recommended.  The tank should have only a soft, fine bottom to prevent damage to barbels and should be heavily planted.[4] Feeding is not difficult and they accept almost anything, although live worms are especially appreciated.[5] It does well in a community tank and does not tear up the plants.[5] Spawning has been achieved in captivity.[4] Typically, the fish are separated into a breeding tank in the ratio of three males to two females, all well-conditioned on live foods.  The couple will spawn while sitting on the bottom, not while swimming as many similar species do. In captivity, the female collects the eggs in her pelvic fin basket and pastes them individually to plants and other objects.  Eggs will be deposited by the female throughout the tank, but especially on any floating surface plants.  According to most reports, the parents do not immediately try to eat the eggs.  The eggs hatch in about four days and the fry become free swimming two days later."

It is native to South America, and is found in the western Amazon basin in Ecuador and Peru. This species is traditionally placed in Brochis but the genus is a synonym of Corydoras.[1][2] FishBase continues to recognize Brochis as a valid genus.[3] The fish has about 17 dorsal fin rays as compared with the 11 or 12 commonly seen in Corydoras splendens. The snout is considerably longer than other species in the genus which explains the common name. The fish will grow in length up to 6.7 centimetres (2.6 inches).[citation needed] The hog-nosed catfish lives in a tropical climate in water with a 6.0\u20137.2 pH, a water hardness of 15 dGH, and a temperature range of 21\u201324\u00a0\u00b0C (70\u201375\u00a0\u00b0F).

        "description": " The banded corydoras or bearded catfish (Scleromystax barbatus) is a subtropical freshwater fish belonging to the subfamily Corydoradinae of the family Callichthyidae. It originates in coastal drainages in South America from Rio de Janeiro to Santa Catarina, Brazil.[2] It was originally described as Callichthys barbatus by Jean Ren\u00e9 Constant Quoy & Joseph Paul Gaimard in 1824, from which it was transferred to genus Corydoras as Corydoras barbatus, a name which by which it is still being referred to in the aquarium industry. The species was further transferred to genus Scleromystax in 2003.[3] The fish will grow in length up to 9.8\u00a0centimetres (3.9\u00a0in).[2] This species has pronounced sexual dimorphism. The dorsal and pectoral fins of males reach, or almost reach, the caudal peduncle, and well-developed odontodes are inserted in fleshy tissue on a large area on the sides of the snout in fully grown males.[4] The banded corydoras lives in a subtropical climate in water with a 6.0\u20138.0 pH, a water hardness of 2\u201325 dGH, and a temperature of 68\u00a0\u00b0F (20\u00a0\u00b0C) to 82\u00a0\u00b0F (28\u00a0\u00b0C).[2] It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. It lays eggs in dense vegetation and adults do not guard the eggs. In captivity, as the sperm are released the female sinks to the bottom, resting on one of her pectoral fins while she starts fanning with the other pectoral fin. At this time, some eggs are released which fall into the pelvic fin basket and are apparently fertilized at that time. The banded corydoras is of commercial importance in the aquarium trade industry. Though peaceful, they get larger than most Corydoras and are therefore less suitable for small aquaria.[5]  This Callichthyidae-related article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it."

        "description": " The bronze corydoras  (Corydoras aeneus), also known as the green corydoras, bronze catfish, lightspot corydoras or wavy catfish, is a species of freshwater fish in the armored catfish family, Callichthyidae, often kept as an aquarium fish. It is widely distributed in South America on the eastern side of the Andes, from Colombia and Trinidad to the R\u00edo de la Plata basin;[2] however, as presently defined it is a species complex and a taxonomic review is necessary.[3] It was originally described as Hoplosoma aeneum (based on a specimen from Trinidad) by Theodore Gill in 1858 and has historically also been referred to as Callichthys aeneus.[2] The adult size is 6\u00bd cm for males and a slightly larger 7\u00a0cm for females (2\u00bd to 2\u00be inches).[4]   Females have a slightly higher body frame than males in accordance with their larger abdominal region. Their average life span is 10 years. It has a yellow or pink body, white belly, and is blue-grey over its head and back. Its fins are yellow or pink and immaculate. In common with most Corydoras the dorsal, pectoral and adipose fins have an additional sharp barb and have a mild poison which causes fish which try to attack them to get stung. A brownish-orange patch is usually present on the head, just before the dorsal fin, and is its most distinctive feature when viewed from above in the stream. Their upper sides are often a greenish color, which is the reason another common name for this fish is the green corydoras. Like many other catfishes, females are larger than males in this species.[5] They are found in quiet, shallow waters with soft bottoms that can sometimes be heavily polluted by clouds of disturbed mud from the bottom, but it also inhabits running waters.[2] In its native habitat, it inhabits waters with a temperature range of 25\u00a0\u00b0C to 28\u00a0\u00b0C (77\u00a0\u00b0F to 82\u00a0\u00b0F), pH 6.0\u20138.0, and hardness 5 to 19 DGH.[2] Like most members of the genus Corydoras, these catfish have a unique method of coping with the low oxygen content that prevails in such environments. In addition to utilizing their gills like any other fish, they rapidly come to the surface of the water and draw air in through their mouth. This air is then absorbed through the wall of the intestine and any surplus air is expelled through the vent.[2] It typically stays in schools of 20 to 30 individuals.[2] It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter.[2] Reproduction occurs with the onset of the rainy season, which changes the water chemistry.[2] Females spawn 10\u201320 egg-clutches with multiple males at a time, but an entire egg clutch is inseminated by the sperm of a single male.[5] In laboratory observations, it was found that bronze corydoras have a unique method of insemination. When these fish reproduce, the male will present his abdomen to the female. The female will attach her mouth to the male's genital opening, creating the well-known \"T-position\" many Corydoras exhibit during courtship. The female will then drink the sperm. The sperm rapidly moves through her intestines and is discharged together with her eggs into a pouch formed by her pelvic fins. The female can then swim away and deposit the pouch somewhere else alone. Because the T-position is exhibited in other species than just C. aeneus, it is likely that they also exhibit this behavior.[6] In the wild, eggs are laid on waterweeds.[5] Males do not form territories or compete over females; interference between males might only happen when two males present their abdomens simultaneously. On the other hand, females do not choose between males. Mating is more or less random; therefore, male reproductive success is directly related to courtship frequency.[5] The eggs of C. aeneus exhibit a unique surface pattern with small villi-like protuberances which resemble attaching-filaments of teleost eggs. These structures allow the eggs to be adhesive and stick to a specific place or to each other. The presence of these structures may be related to the turbid habitat in which this species lives.[7] Bronze corydoras are probably the most popular Corydoras species.[8] It is annually bred and shipped in large quantities all over the world[9] It is easily bred and is produced in commercial quantities in the United States, Europe, and Singapore. Most of the available fish are therefore domestic strains. Wild imports are reported to be less easy to breed.[citation needed] They are a hardy and useful aquarium fish despite having a coloration that is by no means striking or unusual. Many aquarists are fascinated by the habits of these fish. They ceaselessly comb the bottom of the aquarium for food and therefore disturb it slightly, sending up detritus and waste material that has settled loosely on the bottom. They prefer being kept in groups of 5 or more, being sociable fish and are ideal fish for a community tank.[2] Other Corydoras species can be placed in the same aquarium, and despite the strong resemblance many species bear to one another, the species will tend to separate out and only move about among their own kind. Corydoras aeneus is not particular about the composition of the water. Adequate conditions are a temperature range of 20 to 28\u00a0\u00b0C (68 to 82\u00a0\u00b0F), pH of 6.0\u20138.0, and hardness of 2\u201330 DGH. The water should have no salt added to it.[8] A fairly dense growth of plants with a number of possible hiding places is greatly appreciated. Corys are easy to feed, they are omnivores eating all flake and pelleted food and also live and frozen foods. When it comes to sperm, then the female glues the eggs, only a few in number, to the chosen substrate and then (sometimes) quickly touches them with her mouth. After several acts of spawning, which span a total of two to three hours, one female will have produced up to 200 eggs. Frequently, two males are used for each female, as one male has difficulty fertilizing all the eggs. The eggs gradually grow darker in color, and just prior to hatching (ranging from three days at 28\u00a0\u00b0C to a week at 20\u00a0\u00b0C) they turn dark brown. The fry keep to the bottom of the tank, feeding on detritus and any fine foods available. The parents may spawn again within two to three weeks. The albino corydoras is an albino variety of the bronze corydoras that has been developed for the aquarium trade, with a pale pink or orange body and red eyes.  It is physically similar to normally-colored individuals, although some breeders report that the fry are a little slower to develop.[10] Others say that the albinos are practically blind and that the males are somewhat sterile, although this may be due to extensive inbreeding.[11] Albino bronze corydoras are frequently injected with bright dye (via a needle) and sold in aquariums. This controversial practice is known as \"painting\" or \"juicing\" fish."

        "description": " The dwarf corydoras (Corydoras hastatus), dwarf catfish, tail spot pygmy catfish, or micro catfish is a tropical freshwater fish belonging to the subfamily Corydoradinae of the family Callichthyidae.  It originates in inland waters in South America, and is found in the Amazon River and Paraguay River basins in Argentina, Bolivia, and Brazil.[1] The specific epithet hastatus means with a spear, in reference to the spearhead-like spot on the tail root. The body of Corydoras hastatus is typically more elongated than other Corydoras species.  Its body is a translucent white to olive color, with a thin dark stripe on the sides from behind the gill cover to the root of the tail, and a whitish belly.  It has a white crescent at the base of the tail surrounding a black spot.  The fish will grow in length up to 1.4 inches (3.5\u00a0cm), but 1.0 inch (2.5\u00a0cm) is more typical.  Males are smaller, more slender and have a more pointed dorsal fin than females. The dwarf corydoras lives in a (sub)tropical climate in water with a 6.0\u20138.0 pH, a water hardness of 5\u201319 dGH, and a temperature range of 68\u201382 F (20\u201328\u00a0\u00b0C).[1] It is found in ponds.[1] It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. They are found in the Paraguay River and Amazon River basins. C. hastatus lives among plants.[1] It is a schooling species.[1] It differs from most Corydoras species by preferring the midwater areas instead of the bottom, spending most of its time well off the bottom in areas of dense plants.  When it rests, it rests on the leaves of the plants.  Other Corydoras species with similar mid-water habits include C. habrosus and C. pygmaeus. The dwarf Corydoras maintains its position in a current by using rapid fin movements, especially with its pectoral fins. These rapid movements, combined with a high breathing rate, give the fish the appearance of being very \"nervous\" when compared with other fish. C. hastatus may even shoal with small characins. The fish lays its eggs in dense vegetation and the adults do not guard the eggs.  The female holds a single egg between her pelvic fins, where the male fertilizes them for about 30 seconds.  Only then does the female swim to a suitable spot, where she attaches the sticky egg. The pair repeats this process about every three minutes for from one to two hours with some 10- to 15-minute rests between egg releases.  Around 7 to 15 eggs are spawned in a single day, and spawning occurs on three to four consecutive days. A total of 30 to 60 eggs may be spawned by a single female over this period of time. The eggs hatch in three to nine days.  The fry are about 6\u00a0mm long at hatching, mostly translucent but sometimes with spots. In two months, the fry average about 18\u00a0mm in length.  The fry mature in six to eight months. The dwarf corydoras is of commercial importance in the aquarium trade industry.   Due to its small size, this fish can be kept in a relatively small aquarium; a 5-gallon (20 litre) tank is sufficient for a small school.  Since it is a schooling fish, it should only be kept in groups of at least six individuals.  It is a good community tank fish when kept with peaceful tankmates such as tetras, rasboras, and danios, but should not be kept with overly aggressive tankmates.  They have also been used as scavengers for fry tanks. The aquarium should be clean, well-aerated, and densely planted to provide hiding places.  A moderate current provided by a power filter or canister filter is appreciated.  The water should be slightly alkaline (pH about 7.6) within a temperature range of 24\u00b0 to 29\u00a0\u00b0C.  Although the fish is generally a mid-water dweller, a fine gravel or sand substrate should be provided since it will occasionally burrow. The fish will feed both in midwater or on a substrate, whether that substrate is a plant leaf, a broad rock, or the bottom of the tank.  It accepts most foods, including freeze-dried, flake, and frozen foods, although live foods are particularly appreciated. The methods of spawning this fish in the aquarium is similar to spawning most other Corydoras species.  The spawning tank can be as small as 2.5 gallons (10 L), but at least a 5-gallon (20 L) tank is recommended with aged water, a sponge filter and some plants.  Fish should be conditioned with large amounts of live foods such as Tubifex and whiteworms, during which time the females will become noticeably plumper.  Since C. hastatus may spawn as a school, the whole group can be conditioned for spawning at the same time, and for best results, there should be at least two males for every female. Spawning of well-conditioned fish may be initiated by the addition of cooler water.  During spawning, very little food is accepted, but the fish will immediately search for food after finishing.  It will typically attach its eggs to the plants in the aquarium, but if not enough plants are available, the sides of the aquarium may be used.  When the fry hatch, they can be fed newly hatched brine shrimp or microworms.  The parents may be ready to spawn again in a couple of weeks."

The body has other gray and black markings on an olive background. Compared with other species of Corydoras, the body is not as tall in comparison to its length, and its eyes are set a bit lower. The fish will grow in length up to 5.1 centimetres (2.0 inches). It lives in a tropical climate in water with a 6.0 - 8.0 pH, a water hardness of 2 \u2013 25 dGH, and a temperature range of 22\u201326\u00a0\u00b0C (72\u201379\u00a0\u00b0F). It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. Though it lays eggs in dense vegetation, adults do not guard them. In captivity, the male is reportedly territorial during the prespawning activities while the female is usually hidden among the plant roots. Both sexes clean the underside of plant leaves. Eggs are fastened under the leaves and are also attached to roots of plants. The elegant corydoras is of commercial importance in the aquarium trade industry. It tends to swim in the upper levels of the aquarium, instead of at the bottom as is common with most species of Corydoras, and does not seem to disturb the sediment as much."

It is occasionally confused with Corydoras sterbai: the difference is that Corydoras haraldschultzi has a pattern of black dots on a gold background on the head, whereas C. sterbai has a pattern of gold dots on a black background. The fish is named in honor of ethnographer and fish collector Harald Schultz (1909\u20131966), who collected the type specimen.[2] "

        "description": " Corydoras panda is a species of catfish belonging to the genus Corydoras, of the family Callichthyidae, and is a native member of the riverine fauna of South America.  It is found in Peru and Ecuador, most notably in the Hu\u00e1nuco region, where it inhabits the R\u00edo Aquas, the R\u00edo Amarillae, a tributary of the R\u00edo Pachitea, and the R\u00edo Ucayali river system. The species was first collected by Randolph H. Richards in 1968, and was named Corydoras panda by Nijssen and Isbr\u00fccker in 1971. The specific name is an allusion to the appearance of the fish, which possesses large black patches surrounding the eyes, reminiscent of those found on the giant panda. Accordingly, the common names for this fish, which is a popular aquarium species, are panda corydoras and panda catfish. Corydoras panda has an off-white to pinkish-orange ground colour, and when observed under certain lighting conditions, a faint greenish iridescence is present upon the flanks and the operculum. The fins of the fish match the body in ground colour, upon close inspection being seen to be hyaline or translucent with coloured fin rays, with the dorsal fin being marked by a conspicuous black blotch that covers almost the entire fin area. The caudal peduncle is marked with a black band, this black band encircling the caudal peduncle from dorsal to ventral surface. The adipose fin, supported by a small fin spine, sometimes contains black pigmentation. The head is the same ground colour as the body, with a black mask surrounding the eyes, descending vertically from the fontanel, over each eye, and ending in a triangular wedge immediately before the ventral surface of the head. The pectoral fins are positioned immediately behind the operculum, and are usually oriented horizontally when the fish is at rest, extended in a manner similar to the wings of an aeroplane. The pelvic fins are positioned upon the ventral surface of the fish, located some way behind the pectoral fins. The first ray of the dorsal fin emanates from the body at approximately its point of greatest elevation, and a vertical line drawn downwards from this point meets the attachment point of the pelvic fins. The anal fin is located far to the rear of the ventral surface of the body, the attachment point of the first fin ray being somewhat forward of the black caudal peduncle marking described above. In common with all other members of the family Callichthyidae, the body surface is covered, not with scales, but with bony plates known as scutes. The lines of demarcation between individual scutes can be seen upon close examination of this and almost all other Callichthyid fishes, and in the case of some specimens of this species, are highlighted by additional black pigment. The fish possesses, in common with almost all Corydoras species, three pairs of barbels\u2014one pair of maxillary barbels and two pairs of rictal barbels. A fully mature adult specimen of this species attains a standard length of 55 millimetres (2.1\u00a0inches): this is the length attained by mature females, which grow larger than mature males, and also possess more rounded body outlines. Corydoras panda inhabits clear river waters that are relatively fast-flowing, well-oxygenated, and flowing over substrates that may comprise soft sand or fine gravel. These rivers are usually well vegetated with assorted species of aquatic plants. The proximity of the home rivers of the fish to the Andes mountain range, and the replenishment of those rivers with meltwaters from Andean snows at higher altitudes, has led the fish to be adaptable to cooler temperatures than the norm for 'tropical' fishes\u2014the temperature range of the fish is 16\u00a0\u00b0C to 28\u00a0\u00b0C, though the fish exhibits a marked preference for the cooler regions of this temperature spectrum, particularly in captivity. Indeed, the fish can, for small time-periods, survive temperatures as low as 12\u00a0\u00b0C, though captive rearing at such low temperatures is ill-advised. The native waters of Corydoras panda are consequently mineral-deficient, with a neutral to slightly acid pH, and replication of such conditions in captivity are recommended for successful maintenance. Corydoras panda has a preference for cooler than normal waters when compared to many other popular tropical fish species. Because of this, those who keep C. panda in community aquarium setting must choose tankmates that share its preference for cooler temperatures of around 20\u00a0\u00b0C (68\u00a0\u00b0F) to 25\u00a0\u00b0C (77\u00a0\u00b0F).[2] Given the cleanliness of the fish's native waters, scrupulous attention to water quality in the aquarium is considerably more important for this fish than for the more domesticated Corydoras species such as C. paleatus or C. aeneus. Additionally, scrupulous attention to aquarium substrate cleanliness is a must, as the fish are intolerant of poor aquarium maintenance in this area, and succumb to stress and disease rapidly if their aquaria are not kept to a high standard. Despite this, the species remains highly popular with aquarists, upon account of the appearance of the fish, and its lively, vivacious behaviour in a well-planned aquarium setting. Like many other Corydoras species, the panda catfish is a highly gregarious fish, and in common with several other smaller Corydoras species such as C. habrosus and C. pygmaeus, manifests a distinct need for numerous companions of its own species in order to thrive, and can thus be described as being more avowedly social than some of the larger members of the genus. A minimum of eight individuals should be housed in the same aquarium, and if space permits, this number should be revised upwards, as the fish exhibits a very definite preference for grouping together with others of its species. They also associate themselves easily with the clown loach and school together in currents where sufficient numbers of their own species is lacking. An aquarium for this species should be well furnished, ideally with a mixture of live aquatic plants, and solid furnishings providing caves, sheltered areas and hiding places to give the fish security. Floating plants to provide additional areas of shade are also welcomed by the fish. Like all Corydoras species, the fish feeds primarily upon animal matter. The aquarist is advised, however, that the traditional use of Corydoras catfishes as putative 'scavengers' in an aquarium setting will be detrimental to the well-being of this species\u2014it requires high quality foods for long-term maintenance, and a varied diet. Ideally, the fish should be given live foods at least intermittently, and will dine enthusiastically upon such items as Bloodworms (larvae of Chironomus midges), Daphnia, cultivated Brine Shrimp (Atermia salina), and Tubifex worms. The last, however, should be cultivated in order to minimise the risk of introducing pathogenic organisms to the aquarium, as Tubifex live in unsanitary conditions in the wild. Freeze dried Tubifex may be preferable, as the risk of introduction of disease is eliminated. High quality flake foods are also appreciated, particularly those containing shrimp or other similar matter. The lifespan of Corydoras panda in the aquarium has not been systematically determined, but given the longevity of other Corydoras species in the aquarium, it is reasonable to assume that well-cared for specimens will enjoy a lifespan in excess of ten years, and frequently in excess of 15 years. Corydoras panda follows, with a few minor deviations, the standard model for breeding for the genus. Stimulus for breeding consists of the influx of cooler, oxygenated waters into their habitat, usually corresponding in the wild with the onset of the rainy season. However, while some Corydoras species require a temperature drop in the aquarium for spawning to be stimulated, in the case of Corydoras panda, the temperature drop appears to matter much less, as specimens have spawned in the aquarium without a temperature drop. The addition of new, clean, oxygenated water appears to be the primary stimulus for this species. In the wild, the appearance of new water courtesy of the rains is followed by an increase in the populations of assorted food organisms, and feeding upon these conditions the fishes for breeding. Once conditioned fish are stimulated into spawning, males begin chasing females energetically. Females begin developing eggs within their reproductive tracts, and when 'ripe' (laden with eggs), become receptive to the attentions of the males. Eventually, one male will succeed in courting a female, using his barbels to provide stimulation to the female, usually beginning with caresses of the female's caudal peduncle, followed by caresses of the fontanel and the front of the head. if the female is receptive, then the male positions himself before the female, so that the female's mouth is in close proximity with one of the male's pectoral fins. The male then clasps the female's barbels between the pectoral fin and the body, and this stimulates the female to press against the male's side. When seen from above, the fish form a 'T' shape when conjoined thus, hence the term 'T position' has become conventional in aquarium circles when describing the breeding of Corydoras catfishes. Once the male and female are in the 'T position', the pressing of the female against the male's body stimulates his release of sperm. Though the exact mechanism of fertilisation has yet to be scientifically documented, from the observations of aquarists who have been successful in breeding Corydoras catfishes, it seems likely that the female takes the male's sperm through her mouthparts, and directs them through the gills, in a current that carries the sperm to her pelvic fins. At this point, the female releases a single egg (occasionally two), and purses her pelvic fins in order to provide a receptacle for the freshly extruded egg, which is then fertilised. One difference observed between the adoption of the 'T position' in Corydoras panda, when compared to other Corydoras species, is that the exercise is frequently more acrobatic in appearance, with the 'T position' being adopted in mid-water, some distance above the substrate, rather than resting upon the substrate as is the case with the majority of other Corydoras. Once the female is carrying a fertilised egg within her pelvic fins, she then seeks an egg deposition site. The choice of such a site is frequently, though not always, a mass of fine leaved aquatic vegetation. In the aquarium, the plant known as Java moss, Vesicularia dubayana, is of considerable utility as an egg repository for Corydoras catfishes, even though the plant is not a South American native, and panda catfish females will choose large clumps of this plant readily as safe deposition sites for fertilised eggs. The female is frequently pursued by one or more males as she seeks the deposition site, each male presumably seeking to be the chosen mate to fertilise the next egg. Up to 25 eggs may be produced by a single female during a single spawning, which may take place over four to five hours. Fertile Corydoras panda eggs require approximately 3\u20134 days development time before hatching, if kept at a temperature of 22\u00a0\u00b0C. This development time will vary with temperature, taking longer in cooler water. Upon hatching, the fry are four millimetres long, translucent, but already possessing the basic ground colour of the species, and upon close examination, possess fully formed barbels. Even newly hatched fry possess at least some hint of the adult eye patches, and as the fry grow, these patches darken and become more prominent. Even so, at just four millimetres in length, the fry are practically invisible against typical aquarium gravel unless seen to move. The fry take approximately four weeks to develop to the point where the finfold, a continuous undifferentiated membrane resembling that seen at the posterior of a tadpole, has differentiated into the unpaired fins (dorsal, anal and caudal fins). During this time, size will have increased to approximately eight or nine millimetres, and the fish will begin to develop colour changes leading to that of the adult fish. From this point, the caudal peduncle patch and dorsal fin patch will begin to appear, but the body will also be seen to be covered in fine black 'pepper dots' between these black patches. Only after a period of 10 to 12 weeks, at which point the fish has assumed a size of 12 to 14 millimetres, will the fish attain the colouration of the adult, and be in all respects a perfect miniature of the parents. Fry of this species are particularly sensitive to changes in water chemistry and to elevated temperatures. While adult fishes can withstand temperatures of 28\u00a0\u00b0C, fry will die of heat stress if exposed to temperatures above 26\u00a0\u00b0C, and their chances of survival are enhanced if the water temperature is kept at 22\u00a0\u00b0C or below. Water changes made to a nursery aquarium during the first 21 days of life of the fry\u2014the critical period during which they manifest the greatest sensitivity to their environment\u2014must be gradual, and the incoming water conditioned to match that of the existing aquarium water where possible before the water change takes place. While the fry are likely to develop best if given infusoria as part of their feeding r\u00e9gime, it is possible to raise fry to adulthood entirely upon prepared foods."

        "description": " Corydoras paleatus is a species of catfish (order Siluriformes) of the family Callichthyidae. Its common names include blue leopard corydoras, mottled corydoras, and peppered catfish.[1] It originates from the lower Paran\u00e1 River basin and coastal rivers in Uruguay and Brazil.[1] This fish species reach about 5.9 - 7 centimeters (2.3 - 2.75 \u00a0in) SL.[1] The male is smaller than the female, and in proportion to body length, the dorsal fin and pectoral fins are longer on the male than the female.[2] Corydoras paleatus is found in the Amazon basin,[1] and feeds on worms, crustaceans, insects, and plant matter.[1] C. paleatus has been known to produce sound; it does this by the abduction of its pectoral fins. This is used by males during courtship and intrapersonal communication, and by both sexes and juveniles when distressed.[2] In reproduction, males do not behave aggressively toward each other, nor do they monopolize mating areas or females.[2] The T-position is involved in courtship, as with many other Corydoras species.[2] Charles Darwin discovered the C. paleatus when he went to Buenos Aires during his expedition aboard the Beagle during the 1830s.[3] It is a very good choice for the community aquarium, as it is a hardy,[4] good-looking, and peaceful fish.[4] They can be successfully kept with other small, peaceful aquarium fish like livebearers, danios, and tetras. It is sometimes seen in the shops as an albino form, although this is similar to other albino corys (see the C. aeneus albino form). It grows to around 7.5\u00a0cm and is easily bred at home. These fish prefer a planted tank with temperatures around 16 to 24 \u00b0C (61 \u2013 75 \u00b0F), although they can take lower temperatures than this as it originates from colder waters.[3] Their high temperature tolerance seems poor, and 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F) is the highest safe temperature. They like to nibble on the algae that grow on floating plants but are not specialized algae-eating catfish. The lighting must not be too bright, and hiding places, such as bogwood, are needed as they like to hide from the light during certain parts of the day. Heavily planted areas should also be provided, where the light is minimized, as they like darker areas due to their bottom-feeding nature. Diet should be sinking pellets, algae wafers, frozen and live food, such as bloodworm or daphnia. They may also occasionally enjoy blanched spinach, which can be attached to plants with a peg or the side of the glass with magnetic clips. They can be seen to dart to the top of the tank: this is because they can use atmospheric oxygen to supplement what their gills extract from the water.[5] They will do this more frequently  when water quality is starting to deteriorate, and so should be watched for this indication. Peppered corydoras reach their sexual maturity and start to show reproductive behaviors once the females reach an average (minimum) size of 5.625 cm (2.214 inches) and once the males reach about 4.875 cm (1.919 inches).[citation needed] The males initiate the courtship ritual, which entails chasing the females around the tank. The female darts away, and the males search for her and find her a few moments later. The males shiver all over the female and may lie down on top of her. When she is ready to spawn, she turns to the male next to her and pounds below his ventral fin. The pair go into the \"T-position\" with the male releasing the sperm into the female's mouth before the sperm fertilizes the eggs[citation needed]. The female cups her ventral fins and lays a few eggs (usually between 4 and 12 eggs[citation needed]) in her fins.  The eggs are about 1.8 mm in diameter[citation needed]. The female now starts cleaning a spot on the glass to put her eggs on. Corydoras are egg depositors and lay their eggs all over the aquarium. Favorite spots include the heater, filters, and the glass, although, occasionally eggs are also laid on plants and driftwood. After depositing a group of eggs closely together, the female rests for a few moments. The males regroup and start chasing each other and then resume chasing the female. The males are so relentless in this pursuit that they try to mate with the female even while she is busy laying her eggs. The spawning lasts more than an hour, and many eggs are laid in different places. On average, about 50 to 150 eggs are laid during a single spawning[citation needed]. The incubation period for the eggs for peppered corydoras was found to be between 96 hours and 113 hours at 24\u00b12\u00b0C, with the average incubation period being about 102 hours (or 4.25 days)[citation needed]. In one study, the average hatching ratio of the eggs was found to be approximately 87%, with the overall egg-laying period lasting between 20 and 35 days[citation needed]. Peppered cories can eat their eggs, but will not eat the living fry.  At first, the fry is small (with a mean length of 7.5246 mm[citation needed]) and is unable to eat, sustaining themselves on the last of their yolk sacs. The fry will begin to eat 1\u20133 days after hatching, and will eat the protozoan organisms in the tank and can be fed powdered food at this stage.  By about one month, the fry will start to become rounder and will begin developing adult coloration, eventually becoming miniature versions of the adults[citation needed]. The juveniles will reach adult size at around 1 year of age, although this varies between individuals and how well they are kept. The age of sexual maturity also varies between individuals, but juveniles will typically begin breeding at around 8\u201312 months of age. However, they can begin as early as 6 months and as late as 18 months of age. From the onset of sexual maturity, it can take the fish up to another year to successfully produce fertile eggs; at first, entire clutches of eggs may be infertile. Albino strains may develop slower and be less fertile due to inbreeding. Media related to Corydoras paleatus at Wikimedia Commons"

        "description": " Corydoras pygmaeus, or the pygmy corydoras or pygmy catfish[1] is a tropical and freshwater fish belonging to the subfamily Corydoradinae of the family Callichthyidae. It originates in tropical inland waters in South America, and is found in the Madeira River basin in Brazil. The first scientific description of the pygmy corydoras was published in 1966 by German biologist and physician Joachim Knaack, in Aquarien und Terrarien-Zeitschrift.[2][3] One specimen was designated the holotype and one additional specimen was collected as a paratype.[2] The scientific name uses the Latin word pygmaeus, meaning dwarf or pygmy.[4] A species of Corydoras with a similar appearance, Corydoras hastatus was described in the 1880s, and many specimens that were described as Corydoras hastatus between the 1920s and 1950s were subsequently found to be misidentified specimens of the pygmy corydoras.[1] In older literature, the pygmy corydoras is frequently mislabeled due to Corydoras hastatus being the only miniature Corydoras species known at the time.[1] The pygmy corydoras is a silver-colored fish, with an unbroken black line that runs horizontally along the center of the sides of the fish from the tip of its snout to its caudal peduncle.[5] It has a second thin black line along the lower part of the side of the body, from behind the ventral fins and continuing into the tail.[5] The top part of the body has a light black or dark gray shading that starts on the top of its snout and ends at the tail.[5] Newly hatched fry have vertical stripes along the sides of their bodies that fade by the end of their first month, when the horizontal stripes of the adult fish begin to appear.[5] The maximum length of the species is about 3.2 centimeters (1.3\u00a0in),[6] but typical adult sizes are 1.9 centimeters (0.75\u00a0in) for males and 2.5 centimeters (1.0\u00a0in) for females.[1] In addition to their larger length, females are also rounder and broader than males, especially when they have eggs.[7] Young fry grow rapidly after hatching, reaching 13 millimeters (0.51\u00a0in) in six to eight weeks.[1] The pygmy corydoras is widely distributed in inland waters in Peru in tributaries of the Nanay River, in Ecuador in tributaries of the Aguarico River, and in western Brazil in tributaries of the Madeira River.[8] The holotype was obtained from Calama, Brazil, along the Madeira River near the mouth of the Ji-Paran\u00e1 River.[6] The pygmy corydoras lives in a tropical climate in water with a 6.0 - 8.0 pH,[9] a water hardness of 2 \u2013 25 dGH,[9] and a temperature range of 22\u201326\u00a0\u00b0C (72\u201379\u00a0\u00b0F).[9] It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. The pygmy corydoras lays approximately 100 eggs at a time.[9] The female holds 2\u20134 eggs at a time in a pouch formed by her pelvic fins while they are fertilized by the male, which takes about 30 seconds.[9] The female swims to a safe location with the fertilized eggs, where she attaches the sticky eggs to a surface, where they will remain.[9] It is a peaceful fish, shoaling fish and can be kept in a community aquarium of smaller fish species such as ember tetras. It can be fed most sinking foods, flakes, frozen food and sinking wafers. It can be kept with small shrimp and snails. In aquariums, they are often kept on fine grained substrate, such as sand. This enables them to dig through the substrate without injury to their barbels, which can often be lost in sharp substrates. They are often kept at a pH of between 6.5 and 7.0. They are schooling fish that are usually kept in groups of at least four and will also behave much more naturally in larger groups (10 or more). Unlike the larger more common Corydoras, they often swim in shoals around the mid water and lower regions of the tank. C. pygmaeus are peaceful fish which will not thrive with aggressive tankmates. They are perhaps best kept in a planted species tank, or with shrimp such as Neocaridina spp. They seem to do best when offered live foods in addition to prepared food items. Appropriate foods include microworms or similar nematodes, as well as Artemia nauplii (newly hatched brine shrimp)."

It originates in inland waters in South America, and is found in the Upper Orinoco River basin in Venezuela and Colombia. C. habrosus, is often found in periodic wetlands, large floodplains to where other species migrate seasonally. These small corydoras are prone to entrapment in receding waters, and populations can suffer during the dry season.[2] Their natural habitat tends to be abundant in leaf litter and plant life, providing ample cover to allow these fish to roam moderately freely. As a bottom dwelling species C. habrosus tends to stick to the lower regions of the river, however, on occasion corydoras will dart up to the water surface to take in air. They use their intestines as an air breathing organ to absorb oxygen, and expel the remnant air out of the anus.[3] The fish will grow in length up to 1.4 inches (3.5 centimeters). It lives in a tropical climate in water with a 5.5 \u2013 7.5 pH, a water hardness of 2 \u2013 10 dGH, and a temperature of about 77\u00a0\u00b0F (25\u00a0\u00b0C).[4] The diet consists of worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. It is a peaceful fish and can be kept in a community aquarium of smaller fish species such as ember tetras, clown panchax, endler guppies and small species of rasbora.  It should be kept in groups of at least 6 individuals, ideally 10 or more. A shoal should be kept in a tank that is at least 14 gallons in size.[5] Salt and pepper catfish can be fed most small sinking foods including pellets, flake food and preserved baby brine shrimp. Frozen foods such as baby brine shrimp, rotifers and cyclops can also be fed either regularly or exclusively. In captivity, breeding can be difficult to achieve. Some aquarists report that large water changes with relatively cold water can stimulate habrosus in to spawning.[6] Spawning is marked by obvious behaviours; males will swim close to the female, if multiple males are present they will surround the female swimming from side to side quickly. The female holds an egg visibly under her ventral fin ready for fertilising. The female can then be seen to 'massage' the males belly. The female will then choose an appropriate place to deposit her egg, usually on plants near the substrate, particularly on the underside of the leaves but can also be found on the aquarium glass and decor.  Eggs are rarely placed on the top of the leaves or close to the water surface. The spawning male will protect the female from other males attempting to spawn with her.

        "description": " Sterba's corydoras (Corydoras sterbai) is a member of the South American Corydoras genus of freshwater aquarium catfish and one of the most popular species of Corydoras due to its attractive markings. The fish is native to the Guapor\u00e9 River region between Bolivia and Brazil.[1] Sterba's cory is distinguishable from other Corydoras species as it has white spots on a black background on its head. It is occasionally confused with Corydoras haraldschultzi; the difference is that the latter has a pattern of black dots on a white background on the head.  C. sterbai has recently become available in an albino form and a black form. Like many Corydoras species, Sterba's corydoras is a shoaling catfish, and thus should ideally be kept in groups of 5 or more. In the wild it can be found in Brazil and thus, wild caught fish prefer soft, acidic water. However, Sterba's corydoras is a hardy fish and tank bred specimens have adapted to a wider range of water conditions. However, like almost all fish it will not tolerate high levels of nitrates. Unlike some other catfish they are not good algae eaters, but are good at \"cleaning up\" leftover food and detritus from the substrate. Corydoras sterbai are relatively small for catfish, growing to a maximum size of only 2\u20132.6 inches (5.1\u20136.6\u00a0cm). In captivity Corydoras sterbai readily accepts a wide variety of prepared and frozen foods. Flake food is a good staple diet (which will only be consumed once it has fallen to the bottom) as are sinking pellets or wafers. They relish live and frozen foods such as bloodworm, daphnia and mosquito larvae, but ideally should only be fed such foods once a week due to the high amount of protein in them. It is often problematic to feed Corydoras in aquaria with fast feeding mid-water fish such as tetras as flake and sinking pellets are consumed by such fish before they have hit the bottom and sometimes, even while lying on the substrate. However, this problem can be overcome by placing pellets and flake on the aquarium substrate in caves or under bogwood, or other such areas which are not regularly frequented by mid-water fish. The compatibility of C. sterbai is one of their main selling points as with all other Corydoras species as they are very peaceful catfish and can be kept with other peaceful fish. They should not be kept with overly aggressive bottom dwellers, particularly if there is competition over substrate space as there would be in small tanks or tanks with a large amount of \"furniture\". Ideal companions would be similar sized tetras or particularly, dwarf cichlids. Ideally Corydoras sterbai should be housed with a fine substrate such as sand or gravel in order to avoid doing damage to their delicate barbels. However, large gravel will suffice as long as it is not sharp edged. Their only other requirement is that shade be provided for them, by means of overhanging rock, large leaved plants, arching bogwood or caves. Breeding is not too difficult. A tank with dimensions 18\u2033 x 12\u2033 x 12\u2033 (10 US Gallon) is recommended. The breeding ratio that should be kept is 2 males per female. Good diet together with repeated water changes and drops of temperature are usually sufficient. However, raising the fry is not easy due to its high sensitivity. Occasionally problems can arise while transporting these fish as they are capable of secreting a chemical toxin when stressed or overcrowded. For this reason they are never shipped with other fish. The species name of this Corydoras is in honour of Professor Dr. G\u00fcnther Sterba, professor emeritus of zoology of Leipzig University, member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.[2] Professor Sterba is a professional ichthyologist who nevertheless produced several very popular books regarded as virtual bibles for fishkeepers over the 1970s and 1980s, translated into English under the titles Freshwater Fishes of the World, Aquarium Care and (with Dick Mills) The Aquarists' Encyclopedia, despite his degree of isolation at that time by virtue of living in the then German Democratic Republic."

It is often confused with Corydoras trilineatus,[3] the three stripe corydoras. Corydoras julii are small, peaceful shoaling fish, and are typically kept in groups in captivity.[4] Corydoras julii is a relatively small species of fish, growing to be no more than 52 millimeters in length.[5] Its skin is a translucent whitish-gray, with fine black spotting across the body and a horizontal stripe which reaches up the mid-body until it is equal with the front base of the dorsal fin. This spotting pattern is the primary visual difference between C. julii and three stripe corydoras (C. trilineatus), which have larger reticulations, as opposed to spots, and a longer mid-body stripe. C. julii might be further distinguished from C. trilineatus by the spotted pattern on its head; however, C. trilineatus can also show this pattern on occasion.[5] Females are typically larger and rounder than males.[6] Corydoras julii, like almost all Corydoras species, are bottom-feeding scavengers. Their diet consists primarily of small invertebrates which they sift from the substrate, expelling the particles of sand and sediment through their gill openings. In captivity, their diet is frequently sinking pellets rich in insect and other invertebrate proteins, as well as live or frozen invertebrates like bloodworms, daphnia, brine shrimp, and California blackworms (Lumbriculus variegatus).[4] After sexual maturity, Corydoras spawning appears to be triggered by storms.[6] During this storm, the fish eat increased amounts of insects. The water gradually decreases temperature over the course of a few days.[6] Corydoras fish breed in a position resembling a \"T formation\". In this formation, the female swims up to the male's abdomen, and consumes sperm released by the male. The sperm rapidly travels though the female's intestinal tract and fertilizes the eggs in the cloaca. Small, white, sturdy eggs are laid on plant leaves in the wild. Adult corydoras have been known to eat their own eggs.[6]"

The fish will grow in length up to eight inches (20 centimeters).

It lives in a variety of water types, from anoxic conditions (slack water zones surrounded by dense vegetation) to slightly turbid, but free-flowing, streams.[1] It can be found in waters with pH range of 5.8 to 8.3, a water hardness of 0\u201330dGH, and a temperature range of 64\u201383\u00a0\u00b0F (18\u201328\u00a0\u00b0C).[1] When its biotype becomes dry, it can move out of the water, due to its ability to swallow air and use its intestines to absorb oxygen from the atmosphere, to find more water.[1] It feeds at night on fish, insects, and plant matter.  Juveniles feed on rotifers, in addition to the microcrustaceans and aquatic insect larvae they find when digging into the substrate.[1] During reproduction, the male's belly turns orange and its pectoral spines become longer and thicker.  The male builds a bubble nest with some floating plants, fiercely guarding it after the female lays down her eggs.[1] The cascarudo is of commercial importance in the aquarium trade industry and of minor importance as a food source.[1] It can be kept in aquariums, with groups of more than five individuals recommended.[1]"

        "description": " Megalechis thoracata (black marble hoplo, spotted hoplo[1]) is a species of catfish of the family Callichthyidae.  M. thoracata is found east of the Andes in the Amazon, Orinoco, and upper Paraguay River basins, as well as in the coastal rivers of the Guianas and northern Brazil. Recent introductions were recorded in the upper Paran\u00e1 River drainage.[2] Overview: The Spotted Hoplo Catfish is an incredibly hardy and relatively easy species to keep in captivity, with the main difficulty being the maximum size of around 6 inches, or 15\u00a0cm.They are a very peaceful fish, with the only exception being when the males are guarding a bubble nest at breeding time. They can be kept with almost all tankmates, but they will likely eat anything that can fit in their mouths due to their opportunistic nature. This rule also applies for larger fish, as the Hoplo may get eaten or have its barbels or fins damaged by large, potentially aggressive fish, such as South American Cichlids, African Cichlids, larger catfish and most larger fish species that can fit the Hoplo in its mouth or shows aggression. Tank Setup: They require a soft sand substrate, as they are bottom dwellers that can often be observed foraging/searching for food. A gentle substrate is essential, as other coarse grained or abrasive substrates can irritate the fish's sensitive barbels, and even cause them to fall off. To thrive in the aquarium, they need a minimum tank size of 55 US liquid gallons, but as a rule of thumb for this fish, the larger the tank, the better.[3][4] They are semi-social creatures that prefer to be kept in groups of at least five, but still seem content alone or in pairs. The spotted hoplo catfish needs hiding places, usually in the form of rocks, wood and plants, such as variations of Anubias, valisineria, java fern and micranthemum. Floating plants are also appreciated, as they provide extra cover. Water Conditions: Despite the Hoplo being a very hardy fish, like all fish they need a mature, cycled tank with the correct parameters for almost all tropical species. As they are a species of tropical fish, the optimal temperature for them is around 24\u201328 degrees Celsius, but they can adapt to temperatures in the 22\u201330 degrees Celsius range, although this is not recommended and over a long period of time this can lead to elevated stress levels, amongst other health concerns. The natural habitat of Megalechis thoracata is slow flowing, low oxygen parts of the  Amazon, Orinoco, and upper Paraguay River basins. For this reason, catfish of the family Callichthyidae among other fish, have developed a unique way of breathing, where the fish will rise to the surface of the water and ingest a small amount of air.[5] The oxygen is then absorbed through the lining of the stomach and intestine. This is known as gastrointestinal respiration. They will feed on small to medium-sized worms and other invertebrates, small fish, and general detritus. M. thoracata has been observed to produce sounds during territorial behavior in males at their nest sites and especially during spawning, and during aggressive behavior in both sexes. M. thoracata males aggressively defend territories against intruders.[6]"

        "description": " Ancistrus is a genus of nocturnal freshwater fish in the family Loricariidae of order Siluriformes, native to freshwater habitats in South America and Panama. Fish of this genus are common in the aquarium trade where they are known as bushynose or bristlenose catfish. In the aquarium hobby they are often referred to as bushynose or bristlenose plecos instead, but this may lead to confusion as \"pleco\" usually is used for Hypostomus plecostomus and its allies and is often used as a catchall term for any loricariids remotely resembling that species. The type species is Ancistrus cirrhosus.[1] This genus is the largest genus within the tribe Ancistrini.[2] The name ancistrus derives from the Ancient Greek agkistron \"hook\"\u00a0\u2013 a reference to the form of the cheek odontodes. The genera Pristiancistrus, Thysanocara and Xenocara are now synonyms of Ancistrus.[2] Ancistrus species show all the typical features of the Loricariidae. This includes a body covered in bony plates and a ventral suckermouth.[3] The feature most commonly associated with the genus are the fleshy tentacles found on the head in adult males; females may possess tentacles along the snout margin but they are smaller and they lack tentacles on the head.[3] Tentacules, tentacles directly associated with odontodes, develop on the pectoral fin spine of the males of some species.[3] Males also have evertible cheek odontodes which are less developed or absent in females. They also lack odontodes along the snout.[2] In comparison with a typical loricariid (pleco), a bristlenose is typically shorter (4\u20136 inches or 15\u00a0cm or less), more flattened and fatter with a comparatively wider head. Colouration is typically mottled brown, grey or black. Small white or yellow spots are common.[2] In contrast to many other loricariid 'plecos' (many of which regularly exceed a foot in captivity), the bristlenose plecos do not usually exceed six inches in length; they can thus be kept in relatively small tanks, contributing to their popularity in the aquarium hobby. Ancistrus species are unusual among vertebrates in possessing an X0 sex-determination system, which is the prevailing method in many lineages of arthropod but is very rare elsewhere in the animal kingdom.[4] Ancistrus is one of the widest ranging Loricariid genera, and representatives are found in most areas where the family in general is present.[2] Many species are found in the rivers and floodplain areas of the Amazon basin, but there are also species elsewhere in tropical South America, as well as species on the island of Trinidad and two species, A. centrolepis and A. chagresi in Panama.[5] Three species are true cavefish (troglobites): A. cryptophthalmus, A. galani and A. formoso.[6][7] These are the only known loricariids that possess adaptions for a subterranean lifestyle, such as reduced pigmentation (appearing overall whitish) and eyes.[6] In the wild, Ancistrus species prefer flowing water, so tanks with flow are typically used when keeping them in captivity. Since they are bottom-dwelling fish, substrate is considered preferable to a bare tank floor. Mixtures of gravel, dirt, and clay are frequently used as substrate for Ancistrus. The aquarium size that is considered by some to be a minimum for fish of this genus is 25 gallons.[8] There are currently 76 recognized species in this genus:[9] The diet of this genus is typical for a Loricariid\u00a0\u2013 algae, aufwuchs, and detritus, with sediment, sand, and gravel presumably ingested accidentally alongside food items.[13][14][15][16][17][18] Despite reports among fish-keepers that they require wood in their diet, no scientific evidence to date supports members of this genus feeding on wood.  Bristlenoses do not school but hide when not feeding, juveniles however are typically found in brightly lit shallows at the water margin making them susceptible to predation by birds. Ancistrus species have the capability of obtaining oxygen through their modified stomach.[19] This allows them to survive in conditions with low oxygen levels.[2] Breeding takes place in hollows, caves and mud holes in banks. Males may clean the inside of the cavity with their suckermouth before allowing the female to approach and inspect the nest.  Courtship includes expanding the dorsal and caudal fins and attempts by the male to escort the female to the nest. While the female inspects the nest, the male keeps close contact.[3] The female may lay 20\u2013200 adhesive eggs, usually to the ceiling of the cavity.[3] The female plays no role in parental care; the male takes care of its young. Males will clean the eggs and the cavity with its fins and mouth. Males inspect eggs to remove diseased or infertile eggs, and aerates the clutch by fanning them with its pectoral and pelvic fins.[3] During this time, a male usually will not leave the cavity to feed, or will leave only occasionally and quickly return.[3] The eggs hatch in 4\u201310 days over a period of 2\u20136 hours; the male guards the eggs for 7\u201310 days after hatching.[3] The fry remain in the cave, attaching to the walls and ceiling with their mouths, absorbing their yolk sac in 2\u20134 days and becoming free swimming.[3] Males of these species are competitive and territorial. Males display to each other by positioning themselves parallel to each other, head to tail, with dorsal and caudal fins erect and cheek odontode spines everted. If this escalates to combat, the males will circle each other and direct attacks at the head.[3] If an intruding male manages to evict another male from the nest, it may cannibalize the other male's young.[3] A male bristlenose may guard several clutches of eggs simultaneously. Females prefer males that are already protecting eggs and may prefer males that are protecting larvae; it has been suggested that the tentacles may act as a fry mimic to attract females, which would allow males without eggs in their nest to compete with males guarding eggs.[3] Several clutches in various states of development from eggs to free-swimming larvae can be found in one nest.[2] These fish are often kept by aquarists, as they are dutiful algae-eaters and smaller in adult size than the common plecos usually seen in pet shops. They reach up to 15\u00a0cm in males, and 12\u00a0cm in females. Their recommended temperature is 23\u201327 degrees Celsius. Their lifespan is up to 12 years. They are hardy animals, tolerant to a wide range of water conditions. They breed easily in captivity, and are compatible with most other freshwater fish. Though typically mottled brown or black-and-grey spotted in color, other species are more exotic\u00a0\u2013 spots of bright yellow on a dark background being a common pattern. Albino variants are also common. The albino morph is not caused by exposure to light during development, it is a morph controlled by genetics.[20] Historically, commonly available species of Ancistrus were Ancistrus cirrhosus and Ancistrus temminckii; other species are now available, though exact identification is difficult. Feeding is easy, bristlenoses will graze on algae/ algae wafers and other surface growing organisms as well as eating algae wafers or tablets, flake food, squash, spinach, cucumber, zucchini, green beans peas and even sliced carrots. They have also been known to accept frozen bloodworms as part of their diet. Aquarium specimens may starve for lack of algae or other plant matter; algae wafers or other low-protein foods are recommended. Keepers should watch for the abdomen to take on a sunken appearance, indicating insufficient nutrition. Sexing is very easy as the female will only occasionally have bristles, around the edge of the chin, whereas the male will have them up the center of the head. Breeding is also possible. Males attract females to a small cave or hollow, then guard eggs after fertilization through hatching (4\u20138 days) until fry are free swimming (4\u20136 days after hatching); the aquarist need only supply a suitable cave, food, and one of each sex. Caution should be taken with the spines (odontodes)\u00a0; although the risk of personal injury is small with this genus, the hooked nature of the odontodes means that a bristlenose may become trapped in non-natural material such as sponge filters and netting."

They inhabit flowing sections of rivers, especially clearwater, in the basins of the Amazon (notably Trombetas, Tapaj\u00f3s, Xingu and Tocantins) and Orinoco (notably Ventuari) in Brazil and Venezuela. The largest species reach up to 34\u00a0cm (13\u00a0in) in total length.[2] Most Baryancistrus are differentiated from other related genera by a membrane connecting their dorsal fin and adipose fin, not present in most other genera.[3] The species of this genus are mainly herbivores and detritivores, but may take other foods in an aquarium setting. Most have probably not been bred in captivity. It is difficult to sex these fish, including adult specimens. These fish are mainly nocturnal, but will also emerge from their hiding places during the day, after some time getting accustomed to the aquarium. Adequate hiding places are recommended for these fish due to their primary nocturnal nature. There are currently eight recognized species in this genus:[2][4] Though there are many types of fish described as Baryancistrus, there are many that yet to be given a true scientific designation, and are only referred to under the L-number system, including the Gold Nuggets. Here is a list of Baryancistrus by L-number designation. The common name and scientific name are included when available, though some of these fish are only commonly referred to by their L-number. For those fish without a scientific name, they are assumed to be Baryancistrus sp. * Note: L200 is also used to refer to Hemiancistrus subviridis, another Loricariid that is very similar in appearance to B. demantoides.

        "description": " Rineloricaria (from the Greek, rhinos meaning nose, and the Latin, lorica meaning cuirass of leather) is a genus of freshwater tropical catfish (order Siluriformes) belonging to the family Loricariidae. They are commonly called whiptail catfish because of the long filament that grows out of the tip of the caudal fin that is characteristic of the genus. With the exception of R. altipinnis from Panama, they are native to the rivers of northern and central South America. Some species are regularly seen in the aquarium trade. This genus was described by Pieter Bleeker in 1862, with R. lima as the type species.[1] This genus is by far one of the most speciose of the subfamily Loricariinae, containing about 30 species.[2] On the other hand, it is one of the least resolved genera.[3] In 2008, 14 new species were added to this genus.[2][4][5][6][7] Hemiloricaria, Fonchiiichthys, and Leliella been variably considered synonyms of Rineloricaria; these genera were erected to account for differences in sexually dimorphic traits. However, the traits used to diagnose these genera have been thought to be insufficient.[2] There are currently 67 recognized species in this genus:[8] The genus is widely distributed on nearly the entire subcontinent, from Costa Rica to Argentina, on both slopes of the Andes.[11] Rineloricaria species are found in a large variety of habitats, including large rivers, streams, and lagoons, associated with bottoms consisting of sand or rocks, sometimes found in marginal vegetation. They are also found to tolerate environments with a wide temperature gradient.[6] Rineloricaria have an adaptive capacity enabling many species to exploit the most varied habitats; some species, such as R. strigilata, have been caught in highly polluted bodies of water and represent some of the main components of the ichthyological diversity in such habitats.[3] The average length of a Rineloricaria catfish is about 13\u00a0cm (5\u00a0in) long.[citation needed] The fish are long, slender, have no visible barbels, an erect dorsal fin, a very thin caudal peduncle, and a narrow face. The coloration of the fishes is usually light brown with darker blotches, and have a dark dorsal fin.[citation needed] They are also covered with bony plates and have a sucker disk mouth, as is common with most fish in the family Loricariidae. Sexual dimorphism includes hypertrophied development of the odontodes along the sides of the head, on the pectoral spines and rays, and predorsal area of mature males. Several species also show hypertrophied development of the odontodes on the entire caudal peduncle.[11] In males, the pectoral fin spine is often thick, short, and curved when compared to the female.[2] Rineloricaria are cavity brooders. Numerous eggs (often more than 100) are laid attached to one another in single layer masses on the cavity floor, and are brooded by males.[11] Rineloricaria exhibit high levels of karyotypic diversity with chromosome numbers ranging from 36 to 70.[11]"

        "description": " The genus Panaque contains a small number of small to medium-sized South American suckermouth armoured catfishes that are notable for being among the very few vertebrates that feed extensively on wood.[1]  In addition, algae and aufwuchs are an important part of the diet, and they use their rasping teeth to scrape this from rocks. These fish are also popular aquarium fish, where the sound of scraping as these fish forage for food is easily audible.[citation needed] Scobinancistrus and Panaqolus are sometimes considered to be subgenera of this genus.[2] There are currently seven recognized species in this genus:[3] The name Panaque is a Latinisation of a native Venezuelan name for these fish. It is pronounced \"pan ack\" in Britain and Europe, but often as \"pan aki\" or \"pan a kay\" in America. The Japanese call these fish \"pana koo ee\".[citation needed] Panaque are found in the Magdalena River, Orinoco River, Amazon River, Essequibo River, and Lake Maracaibo drainages.[5] All Panaque come from tropical South American and inhabit fast-flowing streams and rivers. They are weak swimmers but like other armoured catfish possess a strong sucker-like mouth with which they can hold on to submerged rocks and wood.[citation needed] Like other members of the armoured catfish family (Loricariidae), all Panaque have sturdy, armoured bodies covered in toughened plates of skin called scutes. These are not scales; like all catfish, Panaque lack scales. As well their armour, these catfish have very sturdy dorsal and pectoral fin spines. They use these defensively, either to wedge themselves into cracks from which predators cannot pull them, or else to prevent large predators from swallowing them. Another characteristic typical of the armoured catfish family is an iris. Most fish are unable to regulate the amount of light that enters the eye since they have irises that cannot change size. Both male and female Panaque develop bristles, known as odontodes, on the side of head immediately before and onto the pectoral fins.[citation needed] Unlike predatory catfish, these omnivorous catfish have very short barbels. These barbels can be seen in the photograph of mouth of a Panaque shown here; they are the short pointed structures on either side of a suckermouth. This sucker-like mouth allows them to attach to rocks and remain stationary with very little expenditure of energy.[citation needed] Along with the species of the Hypostomus cochliodon group (formerly the genus Cochliodon), it has been argued that Panaque are the only fish that can eat and digest wood.[5] Possible adaptations to consuming wood include spoon-shaped, scraper-like teeth and highly angled jaws to chisel wood.[5] Researchers have also identified symbiotic gut bacteria that may allow the fish to digest the wood they consume.[6] However, others have argued that Panaque do not in fact digest wood, and in fact take up very little energy from the wood they consume and actually lose weight when fed just wood.[7] Furthermore, their digestive tracts are no different from those of related catfish and they do not hold wood particles in the gut longer than other catfish, suggesting Panaque are not physically adapted to eating wood, and are in fact detritivores much like other Loricariidae.[7] In September 2010 scientists from the US National Science Foundation claimed to have discovered a new species of wood-eating catfish in the Alto Pur\u00fas National Park, Peru.[8] Several species of Panaque have become popular aquarium fish. The brightly coloured Panaque nigrolineatus is particularly popular and is known as the \"royal panaque\" or \"royal pleco\", monikers which reflect its comparative costliness and beauty over the common pleco. Royal plecos have a greyish-green base color against which thick, dark bluish-black stripes are set; their fins are edged with gold or cream, and their eyes are red. In captivity, royal plecos typically grow to around 30\u00a0centimeters in length.[9] A second species, Panaque cochliodon, is familiar to many aquarists as the \"blue-eyed pleco\". Though the blue-eyed pleco was widely traded in the late 1980s and early 1990s, it is now only rarely exported from its native Colombia.[10] It is also associated with the binomina Panaque suttonorum and P. suttoni, though Panaque suttonorum is a different fish which only comes from Venezuela. Blue-eyed plecos reach a similar size to royal plecos, but because many specimens are infected with a bacterium closely related to Rickettsia, mortality immediately after import can be high.[11] However, once they have settled in and begun feeding, they are no more difficult to keep than royal plecos.[citation needed] All Panaque catfish require much the same care in captivity. Panaque mainly demand a mixed diet including green algae, fresh vegetables such as carrots, courgettes, and spinach, but because they are argued to be xylophagous, many aquarists provide driftwood for them to graze upon, as well. The meaty foods enjoyed by other plecos are not required. Because they are relatively big for aquarium fish and produce an unusually large amount of waste, a high-capacity tank and filter are essential. Royal panaques tolerate a wider range of water chemistry than others\u2014they prefer somewhat soft, slightly acid water but they will tolerate hard, alkaline water.[citation needed] In terms of behavior, Panaque are peaceful and nocturnal bottom-dwellers which make good residents in community tanks. Like most of the other armored catfish, they are territorial, and groups should only be kept in very large tanks.[citation needed]"

        "description": " Pseudorinelepis genibarbis is a species of armored catfish native to Brazil, Peru, and Ecuador where it is found in the Amazon basin.[1] Pseudorinelepis is one of three genera contained in the tribe Rhinelepini, one of the tribes of Hypostominae.[2] Canthopomus and Monistiancistrus are synonyms of the genus Pseudorinelepis.[3] Previously, Pseudorinelepis was a genus of four species, but now the other three species are synonymous with P. genibarbis.[3] P. genibarbis is large and bulky and reaches a length of 35.6 centimetres (14.0\u00a0in) SL.[1] The armor plates along the side of the fish are thick, are keeled, and encase the whole body.[3] The adipose fin is not present.[3] Like other members of Rhinelepini, they do not have the omega iris that is typical in most species of Loricariids.[3] In Iquitos, Peru, it is known as carachama sin costilla, which actually means \"Loricariid without ribs\"; this refers to the trait that it shares with other Rhinelepini catfish that do not have ribs past the sixth vertebra.[3] This species is highly variable in coloration. P. genibarbis may be completely dark brown to black, mottled with tan to dark brown background and black streaks, or light tan with large, sparse spots located at base of lateral plates, fin membranes, and abdomen.[3] Males have longer odontodes on the cheek that are denser and more numerous than in females. It has been suggested that breeding males may also have orange on the cheeks and dorsal and caudal fin spines, although this may be restricted to fish from the Branco River.[3] P. genibarbis is found in small, sluggish streams, floodplain lakes, and large rivers.[3] Water quality measurements showed that the water tended to be low in oxygen, but neutral (pH\u00a07.0).[1] P. genibarbis is able to swallow air, like many other Loricariids. However, this species is not an obligate air-breather.[1] When disturbed, it is able to swallow air to become neutrally buoyant and swim in the water column.[1] This species is an armored catfish which, since the 1990s, has started to be offered quite regularly as an aquarium fish under the name \"Pineapple Pleco\".[citation needed] The term \"pleco\" here is of course a popular generalisation, as taxonomy has never placed this fish in the former genus Plecostomus. The armour is also pleasantly spiked along the sides of the fish, which causes the pineapple resemblance celebrated in the commercial name of the species. Additionally, under the L-number system used by hobbyists, it as referred to as both L152 and L095. There is quite a degree of colour variation, which is probably the main reason for the confusion over species. Some males having orange cheeks, which is why \"orange cheek Pleco\" is another common name found in circulation.[4] This is not made any easier by the fact that the fish will gradually darken if left in a tank with a darker substrate and lighten when kept on a lighter substrate. These changes take some time (hours or days) to effect, they do not happen quickly, so there is no real \"chameleon\" effect here, but no doubt it is a useful survival mechanism.[citation needed] From the viewpoint of the aquarist the fish is peaceful, sociable with others of its own type, non-territorial and omnivorous. Unsurprisingly, therefore, they do well in soft water, although pH values of up to 7.5 are acceptable, and the temperature range may fluctuate gently between 23-27\u00a0\u00b0C (73.4-80.6\u00a0\u00b0F.[4] Spawning in captivity has not yet been reliably reported.[4] Sexual dimorphism is slight, being determined mainly by a more rounded body shape in the females, and orange \"cheeks\", this refers to the operculum, in the males. The fish will, unlike most hypostomines, feed on flake from the water surface, turning upside-down to do so.[citation needed] It is also able to augment water-dissolved oxygen with atmospheric oxygen, but does not need to do so, having fully functional gills, so when this fish does gulp it is a useful warning that the aeration in the tank is low.[1]"

P. pardalis has 11\u201313, while the H. plecostomus has only 5\u20138 dorsal rays. It is also commonly misindentified as P. disjunctivus and can be differentiated by its spotted patterning.[3] There is an albino color variation of this species, usually referred to as an \"Albino Plecostomus\".[4] The amelanistic form may also be sold as the \"chocolate pleco\".[5] The species is native to the Amazon River Basin of Brazil and Peru, preferring pH ranges of 7.0\u20137.5. It is a facultative air breather; although normally a bottom-dwelling fish, it has the ability to breathe air from the surface of the water during dry periods or when dissolved oxygen is too low. The Amazon sailfin catfish has been introduced to a number of countries outside its native range.[1] It is recorded in the Marikina River in the Philippines and known as the \"janitor fish\", where it has become a local pest and sold in bulk, in efforts to eliminate the fish.[6][7][8][9] In the United States, invasive populations of sailfin catfishes like the Amazon sailfin catfish have been observed to be ecologically detrimental, as they disrupt aquatic food chains, decrease the abundance of native aquatic species, and degrade aquatic plants or banks of waterbodies through burrowing and tunneling.[10]"

Hypostomus punctatus is a freshwater fish native to South America, in the coastal drainages of southeastern Brazil and Uruguay. It is one of a number of species commonly referred to as \"plecostomus\" or \"common pleco\" by aquarists. H. punctatus is a species of loricariid catfish. Like other members of this family, it possesses a suckermouth, armor plates, strong dorsal and pectoral fin spines, and the omega iris. This species reaches about 30 centimetres (12\u00a0in) TL.[1] Hypostomus punctatus is difficult to distinguish from closely related species, such as Hypostomus plecostomus. Identification is relatively difficult as there are many different similar species labelled as \"common pleco\". This species has a light brown coloration with a pattern of darker brown spots (its specific epithet, punctatus, means \"spotted\"). Because of this, the species may also be known as the spotted hypostomus. The species is not notably striped and is generally lighter in coloration than H. plecostomus.[2] H. punctatus is found in the wild in fast-flowing rivers as well as in flooded areas. It prefers water with a temperature of 22\u201328\u00a0\u00b0C, a pH range of 5\u20138, and a dH range of 0.5\u201325.[1] H. punctatus is primarily herbivorous and feeds on algae and detritus as well as plants and roots.[1]"

Although the name Hypostomus plecostomus is often used to refer to common plecostomus sold in aquarium shops, most are actually members of other genera.[3][1] Suckermouth catfish are of little or no value as a food fish, although they are at least occasionally consumed over their native range.[citation needed] A demand exists for them, however, as a bottom cleaner in the aquarium trade.[4] This species' native range is tropical northeastern South America; it naturally occurs in northeastern Brazil, the Guianas, and Trinidad and Tobago.[5] Confusingly, the name Hypostomus plecostomus (or Plecostomus plecostomus) has sometimes been incorrectly used for several more-or-less similar loricariid catfishes, both in the popular and scientific literature. For example, it has sometimes been suggested that it occurs in southern Central America, but this is an entirely separate species, Hemiancistrus aspidolepis (also known under another synonym, Hypostomus panamensis).[6][7] Some Loricariidae species have been widely introduced to several countries around the world and reported as H. plecostomus.[5] It is erroneous,[1] and the concerned species belong to the genus Pterygoplichthys (either P. pardalis,[8] P. disjunctivus,[9] P. anisitsi[10] or P. multiradiatus[11]). In the United States, a Pterygoplichthys species has been introduced to some regions in the South, most likely released by aquarists into the local waters. For example, they are present in a lake in the neighborhood of Hammock Trace Preserve in Melbourne, Florida. In Texas, reproducing populations occur in spring-influenced habitats of the San Antonio River (Bexar County), Comal Springs (Comal County), San Marcos River (Hays County), and San Felipe Creek (Val Verde County), as well as in drainage canals in the Rio Grande Valley and Houston.[12][13] The same identification issues have spread in the literature regarding the invasive catfishes in Taiwan, with H. plecostomus being one of the numerous names used to designate the species: DNA studies showed the alien fishes were actually P. pardalis and P. disjunctivus (that hybridise extensively).[14] H. plecostomus prefer to live in water between 72 and 86 degrees Fahrenheit (~22.2 to 30 degrees Celsius), with a pH between 6.5 and 7.5.[15] Hypostomus plecostomus is named for its sucker-like mouth, which allows it to adhere to a surface, as well as to hold and rasp at food, including newly hatched and baby golden apple snails as well as Malaysian trumpet snails.[16] This omnivorous species also feeds on algae, aquatic plants, and small crustaceans.[17][citation needed] Hypostomus plecostomus is one of many species of fish that is able to breathe air. Hypostomus plecostomus relies on its gills for respiration in normal and slightly hypoxic water, and the less oxygen present in the water, the more frequently it surfaces to breathe air.[18] The air is taken to the stomach where the oxygen is absorbed, and the air can be kept in the stomach to increase buoyancy, which may help it to feed on vegetation.[19] H. plecostomus is one of a number of species commonly referred to as \"plecostomus\" or \"common pleco\" by aquarists.  These fish are sold when they are young and small, but in the wild, they can grow to be a maximum size of 50 centimetres (20\u00a0in).[20] In captivity, however, a full-grown Hypostomus plecostomus only reaches 15 inches (38\u00a0cm) on average, which could be explained by the subpar oxygen levels in most home aquaria and other practices of bad fish husbandry.[21] In the aquarium trade, this dark-colored, bottom-feeding, nocturnal catfish is often purchased for its ability to clean algae from fish tanks but also contributes a lot of waste to the nitrogen cycle. They are difficult for other fish to harass, both due to the semi-aggressive nature of the fish as well as its thick armor.[22] In Bangladesh, the species, among some other suckermouth catfishes has become invasive. The government is currently on its way to impose a ban on the farming, hatchling production, breeding, marketing and trading of the fish.[23] It has also raised serious concern in India and Sri Lanka.[24] A large variety of common names is used to describe H. plecostomus, where plecostomus and the shortened \"pleco\" are interchangeable in all common names. The names include: The species' scientific name, Hypostomus plecostomus, is derived from the Latin hypo (meaning \"under\"), stoma (meaning \"mouth\"), and pleco (meaning \"pleated\").[citation needed] Many of the common names used to identify Hypostomus plecostomus are also used for other species, which augments the confusion surrounding H. plecostomus and other Loricariidae such as H. punctatus, Pterygoplichthys multiradiatus and P. pardalis. In 2012, Weber, Covain, and Fisch-Muller showed the type series of Carl Linnaeus was heterogenous and comprised two species: H. plecostomus (for which the authors designate a lectotype) and H. watwata.[1]"

        "description": " Pterygoplichthys gibbiceps[1]  is a species of armored catfish native to Brazil, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela where it is found in the Orinoco and Amazon basins. Pterygoplichthys gibbiceps shows all the characteristic features of its genus\u2014a large dorsal fin with more than nine rays, prominent nasal flares and a prominent hump or crest anterior to the dorsal fin as well as a substantial base to the dorsal fin. Adult fish easily attain a length of 50.0 centimetres (19.7\u00a0in) TL and can live for more than 20 years. A typical plec shape is shown, patternation consists of primarily irregular largish brown spots on a yellowish backgroung giving a honeycombed like appearance, additional pattern features common to related species may be visible on close inspection. As this fish grows the spots get smaller. Like most plecs this species is primarily herbivorous though will eat dead animals. In the wild these fish are found in shoals in sluggish rivers of the Amazon and Orinoco river systems, they also occupy flooded land during the wet season. During the dry season P. gibbiceps will aestivate in burrows around 1 metre long dug into mud banks along the length of a river, egg rearing is also presumed to take place in burrow. The species name comes from the Latin gibbus\u2014hump, and caput\u2014head, a reference to the centrally located ridge. Common names include 'gibbys', leopard sailfin catfish and clown plecs\u2014the juveniles have a comical appearance due to the large and obvious spots. Ancistrus gibbiceps and Glyptoperichthys gibbiceps are synonyms of P. gibbiceps.\nThe fish has recently been caught from river Ganges, Banaras and is suspected to be yet another entrant to Invasive exotic list of fish in India. This fish is extremely popular in the aquarium, due to its unusual appearance and its ability to eat algae; the bane of all aquarists. This and other related species are bred in ponds in tropical regions for the aquarium trade. In general P. gibbiceps is peaceful towards other fish though territorial disputes arise with other plecos and fish of a similar or larger size. Though not nocturnal they are more active at night and will spend daylight hours 'hiding' in a secluded location. As the fish grows big (up to 60.96\u00a0cm in the aquarium) a large tank with good filtration is required, in general these fish are tolerant to a wide range of freshwater conditions though prefer well aerated water. The fish will 'gulp' surface air in poorly oxygenated water. A lesser-known trait is its mild camouflage ability, where it can lighten or darken its scales in a tiger-stripe pattern. It may reflect its mood or comfortability with the water parameters.[2][3] Pterygoplichthys gibbiceps is an omnivore. They can be fed with vegetables such as nettles, lettuce, spinach or carrots. Their diet can include meat; such as earthworms, blood worms or chopped shrimps.  They will also eat prepared foods from a pet shop, especially sinking algae wafers. The best way to breed Pterygoplichthys gibbiceps is to feed them with wide spectrum of food. With a good diet, they will grow quickly (up to 30 centimetres in one year). Adult Pterygoplichthys gibbiceps  may eat many aquarium plants. It can be almost impossible to differentiate males from females. Males in a group can be determined as they may become more territorial. Reproduction involves females laying roes into caves or hollows of roots. There is a high rate of mortality until the spawn are five centimeters long. The reason for this is unknown."

        "description": " The zebra pleco (Hypancistrus zebra) is a species of catfish endemic to a small section of the Rio Xingu in Brazil. It occurs in the big bend area of the river, downstream from the town of Altamira, Para. It was first described in 1991.[3] It gets its name from its black and white stripes, resembling the colouration of a zebra. This species grows to a length of 6.4 centimetres (2.5\u00a0in) SL.[3] This species was exported from Brazil in 1987 for sale as aquarium fish. However, currently, the Brazilian government bans the export of certain fish species, including H. zebra. H. zebra is threatened by the Belo Monte Dam in the Xingu river which has caused a severe reduction of the water flow of the entire known distribution range of the species. Due to this, the species has been classified as critically endangered and may soon become extinct in the wild. It is subject to several captive breeding programs. It is commercially bred in captivity for the aquarium trade. Mature males have a wider head and longer interopercular spines than females. After spawning, the males will guard the eggs. The fry swim after seven days and absorb the yolk sac in two weeks.[4] The minimum tank size for the species is said to be a minimum of 30 gallons (approximately 115 liters).\u00a0Maintaining water parameters at certain levels is also of importance when keeping them in an aquarium. The ideal water temperature for their tank is about 79\u201388\u00a0\u00b0F (26\u201331\u00a0\u00b0C). Reasonable water acidity levels are 6.5 pH to 7.0 pH with the water hardness ranging between 2 and 6 dKH.[5] Hypancistrus zebra can be referred to using the L-numbering convention often applied to Loricariidae, although, unlike most loricariids, H. zebra has two associated L-numbers: L-046 and L-098 both refer to the species. H. zebra is a predator and requires a high protein diet, typically including small invertebrates such as insect larvae. When in captivity, the species is often fed fresh or frozen bloodworms, brine shrimp and algae wafers. Occasionally, the species may be fed vegetables such as lettuce, cucumber, and squash.[5] This species should not be kept in the typical community aquarium, or with discus, despite advice to the contrary. These catfish thrive in biotopes with small dither fish which do not compete with H. zebra for food. The tank should mimic their natural environment with a substrate of small smooth gravel and pebbles with smooth boulders, cobbles and rocks forming caves and crevices.[6] The water must be highly oxygenated with a strong flow and surface agitation. It is an expensive species because it can only be collected or reproduced in small numbers. It is a simple fish to keep but it needs clean, warm water and a fast-moving current. They are unlikely to survive in still water or a dirty environment.[4] It is nocturnal, moderately territorial, and prefers plenty of hiding places.[4] In 2004, the zebra pleco was added to the IBAMA list of endangered species and exporting it from Brazil was made illegal. However, this law is only present in Brazil and black market fish traders smuggle them out of Brazil to then sell in other countries (primarily Colombia). Similarly to other Hypancistrus species, the male will trap the female in a cave where she will lay her eggs for the male to fertilise. This is usually done at around a pH of 6.5-7.2 and a water temp of 27\u00b0. This process can take between 1 and 5 days depending on the experience the female has in motherhood. The male will often bite the female to keep her in the cave, which is a natural behaviour for the species. Once the eggs are fertilised, the female will leave, although the male will guard the eggs until they hatch and may even stay to see them develop into fry. Once born, the fry will have a yolk sack attached to their underbelly, which is typically gone in a few days.[7] The species is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that international trade (including in captive bred specimens) is regulated by the CITES permitting system.[2]"

Named for its sail-like dorsal fin, the part of its scientific name multiradiatus means \"many-rayed\" and refers to the rays of the dorsal fin. P. multiradiatus is one of a number of species commonly referred to as the common pleco by aquarists.[1] Other scientific names that were used (as synonyms) for P. multiradiatus include Hypostomus multiradiatus, Ancistrus multiradiatus, and Liposarcus multiradiatus. P. multiradiatus is sometimes confused with Pterygoplichthys pardalis, which is a different species of pleco. P. multiradiatus goes by a number of common names. It can be called the \"long-fin armored catfish\" in Hawaii, \"sailfin catfish\", \"sailfish catfish\", \"many-rayed (multiradiatus) pleco\" or \"radiated ptero\" in the United States, \u591a\u8f3b\u7ffc\u7532\u9bf0 in Mandarin Chinese.\nP. multiradiatus is mottled brown/black and inhabits freshwater streams and lakes and in weedy, mud-bottomed canals in its native habitat: the Orinoco River basin in Venezuela. Its geographic distribution is 10\u00b0N - 1\u00b0N, 68\u00b0W - 61\u00b0W. This tropical, nocturnal bottom-dweller likes warm water at the temperature range of 23\u201327\u00a0\u00b0C, pH range: 6.5\u20137.8, and dH range: 4\u201320. P. multiradiatus browses on substrate, mainly feeding on benthic algae and aquatic weeds, but will also take worms, insect larvae and other bottom-dwelling invertebrates as food. One of the large plecos (growing to a maximum of 50.0 centimetres (19.7\u00a0in) TL), this species likes solitude, is relatively peaceful as an aquarium fish and does well with cichlids and other big fish, and should be kept in large tanks only and with plenty of rocks and driftwood in which to hide. Like many other plecos, it is very important in the aquarium trade. P. multiradiatus has been introduced to Taiwan,[2] Puerto Rico,[3] Florida, Hawaii, Texas, India, and Mexico,[4] most likely as the result of escapes or releases from aquarium fish farms. This species is firmly established in these and other locations, where it is regarded as a harmful invasive species being relatively inedible to people and predators, causing damage to fishing gear, competing and harming against native species and disrupting environments by its burrowing activities.[4] In this context its relative, Hypostomus plecostomus, has also been similarly implicated though it seems likely that in Asia, both or related species are implicated."

        "description": " The zebra oto or tiger oto (Otocinclus cocama) is a fish of the genus Otocinclus of the family Loricariidae that originates from Peru. The zebra oto was described in 2004 from a tributary of the R\u00edo Ucayali in Peru.[2] Its closest relatives appear to be O. huaorani, O. bororo, O. mariae, and O. mura, as well as the more recently described species O. batmani.[3] This fish is found in Peru in the Ucayali River and possibly Mara\u00f1\u00f3n River as well. These fish are found in mid-sized creeks with clear water. It may also be found in small ponds.[1] They associate with marginal vegetation.[2] The zebra oto has a general body-shape like other Otocinclus species. They are small, have a suckermouth, and have armor on their bodies. The zebra oto can be distinguished from all other members of this genus by its vertical stripe-like blotches and its complete lateral line. The zebra oto has the highest number of teeth of any species of Otocinclus. The W mark on its caudal fin distinguishes this fish from all others except for O. batmani. The zebra oto reaches about 4.4\u00a0cm (1.7\u00a0in) in SL, though the males are smaller.[2] The zebra oto is listed as endangered by the IUCN Red List due to its limited range and overexploitation for the aquarium trade. Additionally, it is not protected in any part of its range, nor is it listed on CITES. The species has a decreasing population trend in the wild.[1] The zebra oto has been for sale in the aquarium trade since the early 1990s. It has been popular since at least 2000.[2] They are an occasionally seen species, and are bred in Asia in good numbers.[4]"

        "description": " Panaqolus maccus, commonly called the clown panaque, clown plecostomus, clown pleco, or ringlet pleco, is a dwarf loricariid. By numbering systems such as the L-number system, this fish may also be known as L104, L162, or LDA22.[1] This fish is endemic to Venezuela where it is found in the tannic Apur\u00e9 and Caron\u00ed River basins.[2] Their natural environment is driftwood tangles near riverbanks.[1] This species is a small loricariid. It reaches a length of 8.8 centimetres (3.5\u00a0in) SL.[2] This species has a striped pattern. However, this colouration may change with age. There are specimens with straight bars, but there are also specimens with a broken or wavy pattern. The wavy pattern form is found in the actual Orinoco and its tributaries in Bolivar State, Venezuela, while the \"normal\" patterned P. maccus comes from further north and west (Cojedes, Portuguesa, Guarico, and Apure States) in the Llanos where the drainages run into the Apure River.[1] Panaqolus maccus is one of the most common species of small, striped loricariids available in the fishkeeping hobby. This species adapts well to aquarium life.[1] They are not too difficult to spawn.[1] It should always be provided with enough driftwood in the tank, as it is a wood-eating fish. However fresh vegetables, spirulina and frozen foods such as bloodworms are recommended to be given as well from time to time. They are very peaceful fish suited for the average community tank. They are a hardy species of catfish and can tolerate various water parameters but prefer softer, more acidic water. Good filtration is needed because of the large amounts of waste they produce, caused by their wood-based diet. It is suited for tanks starting from 15 gallons.[1] It is difficult to successfully breed these fish in captivity. The tank setting and water parameters must be as near to their native habitat as possible. Seasonal changes can be simulated by adjusting the pH and temperature of the water. Soft driftwoods and cave formations give ample hiding places for the females to feel comfortable, and they may deposit eggs at some point.[3]"

        "description": " The redtail catfish, Phractocephalus hemioliopterus, is a pimelodid (long-whiskered) catfish. In Venezuela, it is known as cajaro, in Guyana, it is known as a banana catfish, and in Brazil, it is known as pirarara,[2] stemming from the Tupi language words pir\u00e1 and arara.[3] It is the only extant species of the genus Phractocephalus. This fish is common in the aquarium trade, although its massive adult size makes it unsuitable for all but the largest aquariums.[4] They feed on fish, crustaceans and fallen fruits.[5] They are not evaluated by IUCN. Although the redtail catfish is the only living representative of this genus, there are other members that date back to the upper Miocene, and are only known from fossil remains. P.\u00a0nassi was described in 2003, from the Urumaco Formation at Urumaco, Venezuela. Another fossil species, P.\u00a0acreornatus, is known from the Solim\u00f5es Formation, Acre, Brazil.[1][2] This genus has a minimum age of about 13.5\u00a0million years.[2] Phractocephalus hemioliopterus can reach about 1.8\u00a0m (5\u00a0ft 11\u00a0in) in length, and about 80\u00a0kg (180\u00a0lb) in weight.[6] However, this is exceptionally rare, and most do not approach this size. They average 3\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in\u00a0\u2013 4\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in; 1.1\u20131.4\u00a0m in length. These colorful large catfishes have a brownish back, with yellow sides, and characteristic orange-red dorsal fin and caudal fin (hence the common name). Sometimes the dorsal, pelvic and anal fins are also red. They have a broad head with long whiskers, dark black body and white underneath that extends from the mouth to the caudal fin. It has a pair of barbels on the upper jaw, and two pairs on the lower jaw. Their whiskers are sensitive and have chemical reception cells which are used as the sense of smell. They breed using external fertilization after laying their eggs. They communicate by making a clicking sound to warn off potential dangers.[5] The redtail catfish is native to the Amazon, Orinoco, and Essequibo river basins of South America, in Ecuador, Venezuela, Guyana, Colombia, Peru, Suriname, Bolivia, and Brazil.[2] It is found only in fresh water, and inhabits larger rivers, streams, and lakes.[7][4] They eat during the evening and night and stay motionless during the day. They are bottom-dwellers and move about quite slowly. Red-tailed catfish are territorial fish.[5] Redtail catfish is also an invasive species in Malaysia; they are now found mostly in the Perak River and Pahang River.[citation needed] Due to the potential large size of this species, redtail catfish are considered a game fish by anglers. The current IGFA world record for weight belongs to the Brazilian Gilberto Fernandes with 56\u00a0kg (123\u00a0lb 7\u00a0oz).[8] It is said that the natives do not eat the meat of the redtail catfish because it is black in coloration.[9] In Thailand, it is an alien species that has been introduced by humans, like the common pleco, zebra tilapia, and alligator gar.[10]\nIn some places, it is feared because it has been believed to be the cause of the mysterious drownings of many of the passengers aboard the passenger ship Sobral Santos II when it sank. The redtail catfish is an extremely popular fish in Amazonian-themed exhibits at public aquaria, where they are often housed with other large fish, such as Colossoma macropomum or pacu, and other large catfish. Juveniles are often available as aquarium fish, despite their eventual large size. In an aquarium where they may be well-fed, these fish can grow quite rapidly,[9] and require tanks of at least 10,000\u00a0L (2,600\u00a0US\u00a0gal) when fully mature.[4] Weekly feeding is appropriate for this catfish; overfeeding is a common cause of death in this species.[11] It feeds heavily on live and dead fishes and other meat. Even as a juvenile of only a few inches in length, they are able to swallow many of the more common aquarium fish (such as tetras or guppies), and it is only appropriate to house this fish with other species of relatively large size. Redtail catfish also have a habit of swallowing inedible objects in the aquarium. Though these are often regurgitated, both the swallowing and the regurgitation can present a problem for the fish, and these objects are best kept out of the aquarium.[11] The redtail catfish has been hybridized with other fish, such as the Pseudoplatystoma or Tiger Shovelnose Catfish, through the use of hormones, in attempts to create a viable food fish: the Tiger Redtail Catfish. These hybrid fish sometimes make it into the aquarium hobby under a variety of common names.[11]"

Pictus catfish are sometimes mislabeled as Angelicus cats in the aquarium trade, but the latter name actually refers to an unrelated  African catfish, the mochokid Synodontis angelica.[1] Pimelodus pictus should not be confused with Leiarius pictus, a much larger (60\u00a0cm) pimelodid. Pimelodus pictus, like other members of the Pimelodidae, are known for having extremely long barbels. These can extend all the way to the caudal fin. The fish are silver-colored with black spots and stripes. They have sharp spines on their dorsal and pectoral fins, which makes shipping a difficult task, since the spines can pierce plastic bags and get caught in nets. There is relatively little sexual dimorphism, with females being slightly larger than males.[2] Like many catfish, P.\u00a0pictus has a downturned mouth and a forked tail.[3] These fish are active swimmers and, like many catfish, nocturnal bottom feeders.[1] Two forms are known; a large-spotted form and a small-spotted form. Of the two, only the large-spotted form is commonly seen in the aquarium trade; it does not grow as large as the small-spotted form.[3] In captivity, these fish prefer soft water and are omnivorous; pictus cats eat bloodworms, beef heart, insects, vegetables, and prepared fish foods. They will also eat very small fish such as neon tetras, depending on the size of the catfish. Despite this, they are generally non-aggressive and will not harm fish too large for them to eat. A larger tank is required as these fish are agile and fast swimmers. They are also non-territorial and can be kept with other P. pictus. Besides the mildly venomous sting imparted by the dorsal spine, they are generally harmless to humans. In the wild, Pimelodus pictus has an estimated average trophic level of 3.19.[4]"

They become sexually mature at 56\u00a0cm (22\u00a0in), males at 45\u00a0cm (18\u00a0in)[3] and this species reaches a maximum length of 90\u00a0cm (35\u00a0in) TL.[1] Fecundity seems to be estimated at 8 million eggs per kg,[4] but was recently measured in aquaculture at a lower, and more likely number of 150,000 eggs laid per kg.[3] According to Riehl and Haensch, five subspecies have been described:[5] However, Buitrago\u2013Su\u00e1rez and Burr place P. f. brevifile, P. f. intermedium, and P. f. nigricans, in the synonymy of P. punctifer. P. f. reticulatum is elevated as another distinct species P. reticulatum.[1] Previously, all subspecies except P. f. reticulatum were considered synonyms of P. fasciatum.[2] The species is of interest for aquaculture for food production (and indirectly as conservation measure because it may lower the fishing pressure on wild population), as well as for production of fish.\nMaturation in earthen tanks of fish caught in the wild is not problematic, since manipulation of fish during fishing and transportation is well done.\nReproduction may be obtained with two injections of Ovaprim\u00ae in 24 hours (10% and 90% of the recommended dosis, respectively), ovulation occurs after around 8 hr at 27\u00a0\u00b0C.[3] Incubation of eggs is carried out in \"Zug\" jars and hatching occurs 24 hours after fertilization at 26,5\u00a0\u00b0C. Vitelus resorption takes 3 days but larvae start feeding 2 days after hatching, and may start active cannibalism at this moment. Feeding may start 48 hours post-hatching with freshly hatched artemia nauplii, seven times a day. Larvae must be kept in the dark in order to maximize uniform distribution of larvae in the tanks and therefore food availability.[6] After 15 days, food may be completed and then replaced gradually with ground mammalian liver. After 20 days post hatching, fingerling may be fed high quality pelleted food adapted to their size.  This Pimelodidae-related article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it."

        "description": " Synodontis multipunctatus, also known as the cuckoo catfish, cuckoo squeaker, or multipunk, is a small catfish from Lake Tanganyika, one of the lakes in the Great Rift Valley system in Africa. It is a brood parasite upon mouthbrooding cichlids.  This species grows to a length of 27.5 centimetres (10.8\u00a0in) TL.  This species is a minor component of local commercial fisheries.[2] Synodontis multipunctatus is one of a number of species of upside-down catfish in Lake Tanganyika, which is more famous for its cichlids. It gathers in large schools at depths of about 40 metres (130\u00a0ft) in the lake. S. multipunctatus is notable for its breeding behaviour - it is a brood parasite, similar to the cuckoo from which it takes its common name. Lake Tanganyika is home to a number of mouthbrooding cichlids, which care for their eggs and young by carrying them in their mouth. S. multipunctatus uses these, particularly Ctenochromis horei and Simochromis babaulti, as unwitting caretakers for their children. The smell of spawning cichlids excites S. multipunctatus into spawning, and as the cichlids lay their eggs the catfish will quickly slip in and eat the eggs before they can be collected by the mother. While doing so they also release and fertilise their own eggs. The female cichlid will hastily attempt to scoop up her eggs and, in doing so, will also collect eggs from S. multipunctatus. These eggs will then hatch inside the unwilling adoptive mother's mouth, and proceed to eat the cichlid eggs present before being released by the cichlid. This technique removes the burden of parental care from the S. multipunctatus, and allows them to breed again sooner. Synodontis multipunctatus are a popular addition to cichlid aquariums. They grow to about 15 centimetres (5.9\u00a0in), and can be bred in captivity provided suitable hosts are present. Some aquarists have had success with host cichlids from Lake Malawi and Lake Victoria as well as those from Lake Tanganyika.[3] They can be very aggressive and territorial towards other Synodontis species, they should be kept in groups over 3 to avoid competition between two, and proper cover and cave-like structures should be provided. They seem to be active in the day as much as the night and can prove quite lively. If kept in larger groups territorial issues are less likely.

        "description": " Synodontis petricola, known as the cuckoo catfish,[2] or the pygmy leopard catfish,[3] is a species of upside-down catfish endemic to Burundi, Zambia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Tanzania where it is only known from Lake Tanganyika.[2][4]  It was first described by Belgian ichthyologist Hubert Matthes in 1959.[4]  The species name \"petricola\" is derived from a combination of the Latin petra, meaning stone or rock, and the Latin cola, meaning inhabitant.  This refers to the rocky environment where this species is found.[3] Like all members of the genus Synodontis, S. petricola has a strong, bony head capsule that extends back as far as the first spine of the dorsal fin.[5] The head is about 3\u204410 of the standard length of the fish.[4] The head contains a distinct narrow, bony external protrusion called a humeral process.[3] The shape and size of the humeral process helps to identify the species. In S. petricola, the humeral process is triangular, rough, and is covered in many small, thin papillae.[4] The bottom edge has a poorly-defined ridge on the bottom edge, and the top edge is convex.[4] The humeral process ends in a sharp point.[4] It is about 1\u20442 of the length of the head.[4] The diameter of the eye is about 1\u20449 of the length of the head.[4] The fish has three pairs of barbels. The maxillary barbels are on located on the upper jaw, and two pairs of mandibular barbels are on the lower jaw. The maxillary barbel has a narrow membrane attached near the base and is straight without any branches.[4] It extends at least as far as the base of the pectoral spine, about 3\u20444 of the length of the head.[4] The outer pair of mandibular barbels extends just past the start of the pectoral girdle, about 1\u20442 of the length of the head,[4] and contains four to seven simple branches, usually without any secondary branches.[4] The inner pair of mandibular barbels is about 1\u20443 to 2\u20443 as long as the outer pair, about 1\u20444 of the length of the head,[4] with four to six branches, with many secondary branches present.[4] The skin of S. petricola has a large number of tiny vertical skin folds. The exact purpose of the skin folds is not known, but is a characteristic of the species of Syndontis that are endemic to Lake Tanganyika.[4] External granular papilla are present on the head, but not the body.[4] The front edges of the dorsal fins and the pectoral fins of Syntontis species are hardened into stiff spines.[3] In S. petricola, the spine of the dorsal fin is long, about 3\u20444 as long as the head,[4] is slightly curved, is smooth on the front and with fine serrations the back, and ends with short, white filament.[4] The remaining portion of the dorsal fin is made up of seven dark branching rays.[4] The spine of the pectoral fin is slightly curved, roughly as long as the dorsal fin spine, with large serrations on the back side.[4] The pectoral spine ends in short, white filament.[4] The rest of the pectoral fins are made up of eight to nine branching rays.[4] The adipose fin is large, does not contain any rays, and has a convex shape.[4] The pelvic fin contains one unbranched and six branched rays.[4] The front edge of the pelvic fin is vertically aligned midway between with the back edge of the dorsal fin and the front edge of the adipose fin.[4] The anal fin contains three to four unbranched and seven to nine branched rays; it is vertically aligned with the center of the adipose fin.[4] The tail, or caudal fin, is forked, with rounded lobes, and contains eight rays on the upper lobe, nine rays on the lower lobe.[4] The mouth of the fish faces downward and has wide lips that contain papilla.[4] All members of Syndontis have a structure called a premaxillary toothpad, which is located on the very front of the upper jaw of the mouth. This structure contains several rows of short, chisel-shaped teeth. In some species, this toothpad is made up of a large patch with several rows in a large cluster. In other species of Syndontis, this toothpad is clearly divided into two separate groups, separated by a thin band of skin that divides the toothpad.[4] This character is used as a method of differentiating between to different but similar species of Syndontis.[4] In S. petricola, the toothpad is interrupted, or clearly divided between the groups of teeth on the toothpad.[4] On the lower jaw, or mandible, the teeth of Syndontis are attached to flexible, stalk-like structures and described as \"s-shaped\" or \"hooked\".[3][5] The number of teeth on the mandible is used to differentiate between species; in S. petricola, there are 31 to 50 teeth on the mandible, arranged in a six short rows.[4] Some of the species of Synodontis have an opening or series of openings called the axillary pore. It is located on the side of the body below the humeral process and before the pectoral fin spine. The exact function of the port is not known to scientists, although its presence has been observed in seven other catfish genera. Fish in the genus Acrochordonichthys have been observed to secrete a mucus with toxic properties from their axillary pore, but there is no scientific consensus as to the exact purpose of the secretion or the pore.[4] S. petricola has a small axillary pore just below the humeral process.[4] The back of the fish is yellowish to copper-brown and is covered with large, irregularly-shaped black spots.[4]  In juveniles, these spots can appear larger and sometimes intersect.[4] The underside of the fish is lighter, with small, irregularly shaped spots.  Most of the species of Synodontis of Lake Tanganyika have a recognizable pattern consisting of dark triangles at the bases of all of the rayed fins, present in S. petricola, and the back edges of the fins are white in color.[4] The caudal fin has a black bar that runs from the base of each lobe to the top of the fin.[4] The barbels are white.[4] The maximum standard length of all known specimens is 11.5 centimetres (4.5\u00a0in) and a total length of 13.5 centimetres (5.3\u00a0in).[2][4] In general in Synodontis species, females tend to be slightly larger than males of the same age.[6] In the wild, the species is endemic to Lake Tanganyika, which has a temperature range of 23 to 26\u00a0\u00b0C (73 to 79\u00a0\u00b0F), and an approximate pH of 8.5 \u2013 9, and dH range of 4-15.[7] It inhabits rocky shorelines in the littoral zone, to a maximum depth of 30 metres (98\u00a0ft).[4] The reproductive habits of most of the species of Synodontis are not known, beyond some instances of obtaining egg counts from gravid females.[4] Spawning likely occurs during the flooding season between July and October, and pairs swim in unison during spawning.[8] Juveniles appear to be carnivorous, feeding on water mites, seed shrimp, and insect larvae. Adults feed on algae scraped from rocks as well as small invertebrates.[4] The growth rate is rapid in the first year, then slows down as the fish age.[6] The pygmy leopard catfish practices brood parasitism. It lives among rock piles frequented by various species of mauna: small African cichlids. Courtship behaviour culminates with the female sucking sperm from the male's cloaca. She brings the sperm through her digestive tract to her cloaca, where her eggs meet the sperm. She then rushes into the nest of a cichlid, devours the eggs, and deposits her own. The cichlids then raise the catfish as their own. Data related to Synodontis petricola at Wikispecies"

        "description": " Synodontis angelicus is a species of upside-down catfish commonly named polkadot squeaker, black clown catfish, whitespotted squeaker, pearl squeaker, or angel squeaker.[1][2]  This species is native to the Congo Basin in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of the Congo.  It was originally described in 1891 by Belgian ichthyologist Louise Schilthuis after its discovery in the Malebo Pool of the Congo River.[3]   The specific name \"angelicus\" means heavenly or divine, since juveniles of this species are remarkable for their bright coloring.[3] Adult specimens between 9 and 18 centimetres (3.5 and 7.1\u00a0in) are grey to dark violet, with reddish-yellow to bark brown-red blotches on the head, sides, adipose fin, and partly running together on the ventral surface.[3]   These blotches are evenly distributed and have sharp, distinct edges.[3]   The blotches may be edged with dark violet.  The fins are dark violet with brownish blotches and streaks.[3]   Juveniles between 4 and 9 centimetres (1.6 and 3.5\u00a0in) are strikingly colored, with white, round blotches on a red-violet background.[3] The first ray of the dorsal fin and the pectoral fins have a hardened first ray which is serrated.[2]   The caudal fin is deeply forked with an extension on the top lobe.[2][3]   It has short, cone-shaped teeth in the upper jaw.[2] In the lower jaw, the teeth are s-shaped and movable.[2] This species grows to a length of 25 centimetres (9.8\u00a0in) SL although specimens up to 55 centimetres (22\u00a0in) TL have been recorded in nature.[1] The species is commercially used as an aquarium species.[4]  The polka-dot African catfish is mostly nocturnal.[3] These catfish will excavate the substrate and may nibble plants. They eat smaller live foods and prepared foods. They prefer a water temperature of 24 to 28\u00a0\u00b0C (75 to 82\u00a0\u00b0F), a pH of 6.0\u20138.0 and a hardness of 5\u201319 dGH.[1] Data related to Synodontis angelicus at Wikispecies"

        "description": " Synodontis fascipinna Nichols & La Monte, 1953 Synodontis nigrita, known as the false upside down catfish,[2] is a species of upside-down catfish that occurs widely in northern Africa.[3]  It was first described by French zoologist Achille Valenciennes in 1840.  The type specimen is in the Mus\u00e9um National d' Histoire Naturelle de Paris.[4] Like all members of the genus Synodontis, S. nigrita has a strong, bony head capsule that extends back as far as the first spine of the dorsal fin.[5]  The head contains a distinct narrow, bony, external protrusion called a humeral process.[2] The shape and size of the humeral process helps to identify the species. In S. nigrita, the humeral process is as much longer than it is broad, with a ridge on the bottom edge, and with a pointed back end.[4] The fish has three pairs of barbels. The maxillary barbels are on located on the upper jaw, and two pairs of mandibular barbels are on the lower jaw. The maxillary barbel is long and straight without any branches, with a broad membrane at the base.[4] It extends to a length about 1 to 1+2\u20443 times the length of the head.[4] The outer pair of mandibular barbels is about twice the length of the inner pair, and both pairs have short, simple branches.[4] The front edges of the dorsal fins and the pectoral fins of Syntontis species are hardened into stiff spines.[2]  In S. nigrita, the spine of the dorsal fin is straight or slightly curved, 3\u20444 to 1 times the length of the head, smooth in the front and serrated on the back.[4] The remaining portion of the dorsal fin is made up of seven branching rays.[4] The spine of the pectoral fin about the same size as the dorsal spine, and serrated on both sides.[4] The adipose fin is 2+2\u20443 to 3 times as long as it is deep.[4] The anal fin contains four unbranched and eight to nine branched rays.[4] The tail, or caudal fin, is deeply forked, with the upper lobe slightly longer.[4] All members of Syndontis have a structure called a premaxillary toothpad, which is located on the very front of the upper jaw of the mouth. This structure contains several rows of short, chisel-shaped teeth.  In S. nigrita, the toothpad forms a short and broad band.[4]   On the lower jaw, or mandible, the teeth of Syndontis are attached to flexible, stalk-like structures and described as \"s-shaped\" or \"hooked\".[2][5] The number of teeth on the mandible is used to differentiate between species; in S. nigrita, there are about 30 to 35 teeth on the mandible.[4] The body color is brown or olive to blackish, with round black spots likely.  The fins are greyish to blackish; the caudal fin has black spots or black cross bars.  Juveniles are brown, with black spots.[4] The maximum total length of the species is 33.5 centimetres (13.2\u00a0in).[3]  Generally, females in the genus Synodontis tend to be slightly larger than males of the same age.[6] In the wild, the species has been found throughout northern Africa.  In central Africa, it has been recorded in the Ubangui River basin and the central Congo River basin.  In eastern Africa, it is found in Lake Albert and possibly Lake Kyoga.  In northern Africa, it is possibly present in Egypt.  In northeast Africa, it occurs in the White Nile from Khartoum into the Jebel and Ghazal River systems, as well as the Baro River.  In western Africa, the species is known from the Chad River basin, the Niger River basin, the Volta River, the Senegal River, the Gambia River, the Geba River, the Oueme River, and the Casamance River.[1]  The reproductive habits of most of the species of Synodontis are not known, beyond some instances of obtaining egg counts from gravid females.[7] Spawning likely occurs during the flooding season between July and October, and pairs swim in unison during spawning.[8]   As a whole, species of Synodontis are omnivores, consuming insect larvae, algae, gastropods, bivalves, sponges, crustaceans, and the eggs of other fishes.[7]  The growth rate is rapid in the first year, then slows down as the fish age.[6] Data related to Synodontis nigrita at Wikispecies"

These fish are adapted to spend most of their time upside-down. This is reflected in the fish's pigmentation \u2013 their bellies are darker than their backs, a form of countershading.[3] These fish have lighter colors on the top of their bodies and darker colors below used for camouflage. The lighter colors on the top of them make it harder for predators to see the fish when looking up toward the sky but only when the fish are swimming upside-down.[4] Synodontis nigriventris are mostly nocturnal, and feed on insects, crustaceans, and plant matter.[2] These fish lay eggs.[2] The young fish do not swim upside-down until they are about two months old.[5] Adults swim and rest upside down in the water. They swim faster when upside down, and are more likely to be upside down around objects or at the water bottom. The more objects around the fish, the more they tend to swim upside down.[4] When close to an object, the fish puts its ventral side closest to the object.[4] It rarely swims in the middle of the water, preferring to swim either at the bottom or at the surface.[6] By swimming upside down when it feeds,[7] it can readily catch prey at the surface from beneath.[4] The blotched upside-down catfish is well suited to aquariums because of its small size (typically 9 or 10\u00a0cm or less) and peaceful demeanor.[3] Data related to Synodontis nigriventris at Wikispecies"

The giraffe catfish is found throughout Africa in lakes and rivers, partially due to introduction and establishment in other areas.[2] It is found in many important lakes and rivers such as the Nile and Lake Chad. Its distribution covers includes bodies of water from East Africa to West Africa. It generally lives in shallow waters with muddy bottoms.[1] This fish has a maximum size that sources say are between two and three feet. The giraffe-like pattern will fade with age to a two-tone mottled brown. Various subspecies have been described for this fish, indicating some geographical variation in coloration.[2] Eggs are scattered in a nest and guarded by the male. Dinotopterus cunningtoni takes advantage of the care and allows the male giraffe catfish to care for its eggs and young, an example of interspecific brood care.[1] The giraffe catfish is occasionally imported for the aquarium trade. Because of its large eventual size and its fast rate of growth, it is inappropriate for smaller aquaria. This fish will readily accept a variety of foods and is tolerant of a wide variety of water conditions. They will scavenge the aquarium looking for food, which could cause in the uprooting of plants.[2] This fish is also an important food fish in Africa.[2]"

It uses its power to defend itself and to capture prey. In Africa, it occurs in the Nile and tropical Africa (exclusive of Lake Victoria), Lake Turkana, Lake Chad and Senegal basins. Occurs among rock favors standing water. Active at night, feeding mainly on fish stunned by electric shocks. The electric organ, capable of discharging 300-400 V, is derived from pectoral muscle and surrounds almost the entire body. It is used both for prey capture and defense. This is an Old World catfish. It is reputed that Doctors in ancient Egypt used shocks from the Electric Catfish to reduce the pain of arthritis. This trait is still used today in some areas. It also has the earliest reference of them as hieroglyphics on the walls of ancient Egyptian tombs some 5,000 years ago.[citation needed] Malapterurus electricus is eaten as food in parts of Africa. Being a food fish, M. electricus is also encountered in the pet trade as an aquarium fish. The electric organs of Malapterurus have been used in studies of neuronal metabolism, axonal transport. In their natural habitat they form pairs and lay their eggs in excavated cavities or holes. The male takes the eggs into his mouth. There have been rumours that they are mouth brooders. It is also unknown how the fry is immune to the electric shocks by the parents. Malapterurus electricus is sometimes encountered in aquarium supply stores. It can reach a maximum length of over 1 meter (3\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in) in the wild, but has an average size of 12 inches (30\u00a0cm) in the aquarium. It is quite hardy and greedily accepts most foods, although some experimentation may be required to find the best food. The only other animals that are compatible with this species are snails, which they will ignore. A minimum aquarium size of 55 US gallons (210\u00a0L; 46\u00a0imp\u00a0gal) is required, with bogwood or pieces of PVC pipe. They are active burrowers and will often remove the gravel from under their favorite hiding spot. A minimum temperature of 75\u00a0\u00b0F (24\u00a0\u00b0C) is necessary.[citation needed] It is illegal to possess any species of electric catfish for personal or commercial use in Florida.[2]"

It is commonly seen in the freshwater aquarium trade, but its taxonomy is confusing and was only fully resolved in 2013.[1] It is endemic to Thailand, and found in rivers south of the Isthmus of Kra that drain into the Gulf of Thailand and river basins in the Cardamom Mountains.[1]  There are also unconfirmed reports from Penang in Malaysia.[2] Until 1989, it was considered to be the same as the \"glass catfish\" Kryptopterus bicirrhis, a larger species infrequently seen in the aquarium trade.[1] Subsequently, the ghost catfish commonly seen in the aquarium trade was believed to be the same as K. minor, but in 2013 it was established that the aquarium specimens actually represented another species, which was described as K. vitreolus.[1] The true K. minor, which is restricted to Borneo, has rarely (if ever) entered the aquarium trade.[1] This is a transparent freshwater catfish with two long barbels. Standard lengths may range up to 8\u00a0cm (3.1\u00a0in), but usually only reach around 6.5\u00a0cm (2.6\u00a0in) in total length.[1] They are transparent because, like all catfish, they are scaleless, and catfish within the genus Kryptopterus lack body pigment. Most of their organs are located near the head; with a magnifying glass, their heart can be seen beating. When the light strikes the fish just right, it can create an iridescent rainbow color. During strong illness and after death, they turn milky white. The scientific species name vitreolus is derived from the Latin vitreus, which means glass.[1] Among described species of Kryptopterus, only two other species, K. minor and K. piperatus, have clearly transparent bodies and both these are largely \u2013 if not entirely \u2013 absent from the aquarium trade.[1] The body of others, including K. bicirrhis, are only somewhat translucent or opaque.[1] The aquarium trade in K. vitreolus generally relies on wild-caught specimens, and there are concerns that this may be unsustainable due to the volume and its limited range.[1] Unlike many other aquarium fish, it is not known to be bred at commercial facilities.[1] K. vitreolus reacts to electromagnetic fields owing to a protein encoded by Electromagnetic Perceptive Gene (EPG).[3]"

        "description": " Wallagonia leerii, also known as the Great Tapah, helicopter catfish, and formerly the striped wallago catfish is a species of catfish native to Southeast Asia. Its habitat ranges from the river drainages of Thailand through the Malayan peninsula to the islands of Sumatra and Borneo in Indonesia.[1] It can grow up to 2\u00a0m (6\u00a0ft 7\u00a0in) in length and weigh up to 150\u00a0kg (330\u00a0lb).[1] It has been used as food in Southeast Asia since ancient times.[2] Overfishing for its prized meat has caused the population to significantly decrease. Furthermore, the breeding migration pattern of this fish is especially vulnerable to damming, which has also decreased the wild population significantly. Until osteological research validated the genus Wallagonia in 2014, W. leerii was included in the genus Wallago.[1] The other two species of the genus Wallagonia, the Lesser tapah from the Mekong river basin and the Spotted tapah from the Kinabatangan river basin on Borneo, are currently considered as distinct species. There are, however, strong suspicions that these may in fact be subspecies of W. leerii, as the sole difference seems to lie in a slightly different coloration.[1] The Great Tapah is a large fish, commonly attaining lengths of 150 centimetres and a mass of up to 86 kilograms. The size of this fish however can easily exceed the aforementioned lengths.[3]  It is the second-largest catfish in its family and is only outsized by the wels, Giant pangasius and Mekong giant catfish. It has a short, rounded body and a long broad tail, the anal fin of the fish is about as long as the tail itself and it ends in a forked caudal fin. The pelvic fins of the fish are small, and there are no dorsal spines on it. The Great Tapah possesses a noticeable hump, atop sits its dorsal fin, which is small and almost elliptical. The head of this fish is long, and remarkably wide with a huge lower jaw that extends beyond its maxilla. The mouth of the catfish is inlaid with several rows of sharp teeth that enable it to grip prey. It is a piscivore, primarily feeding on small fish which are snatched mid-swimming and consumed whole. The Great Tapah faces a multitude of threats, as it is vulnerable to destructive fishing, competition with invasive species, destruction of suitable habitat, and dam construction that impact its lifecycle.[4] Splitting of species within the complex may give doubts to the true abundance of the species, meaning it could be far more restricted than once thought. In July, adults migrate downstream to flooded grasslands to spawn. At night, the eggs are spawned near the surface.[5]  This catfish-related article is a stub.

        "description": " The walking catfish  (Clarias batrachus) is a species of freshwater airbreathing catfish native to Southeast Asia. It is named for its ability to \"walk\" and wiggle across dry land, to find food or suitable environments. While it does not truly walk as most bipeds or quadrupeds do, it can use its pectoral fins to keep it upright as it makes a wiggling motion with snakelike movements to traverse land.[2] This fish normally lives in slow-moving and often stagnant waters in ponds, swamps, streams, and rivers, as well as in flooded rice paddies, or temporary pools that may dry up. When this happens, its \"walking\" skill allows the fish to move to other aquatic environments. Considerable taxonomic confusion surrounds this species and it has frequently been confused with other close relatives.[3][4] One main distinction between the walking catfish and the native North American ictalurid catfish with which it sometimes is confused, is that the walking catfish lacks an adipose fin.[5] It can survive 18 hours out of water. [6] The walking catfish has an elongated body shape and reaches almost 0.5\u00a0m (1.6\u00a0ft) in length and 1.2\u00a0kg (2.6\u00a0lb) in weight.[3] Often covered laterally in small white spots, the body is mainly coloured a gray or grayish brown.[5] This catfish has long-based dorsal and anal fins,[5] as well as several pairs of sensory barbels. The skin is scaleless, but covered with mucus, which protects the fish when it is out of water. This fish needs to be handled carefully when fishing it due to its embedded sting or thorn-like defensive mechanism hidden behind its fins (including the middle ones before the tail fin, similar to the majority of all catfishes). The walking catfish is a tropical species native to maritime Southeast Asia. The native range of true Clarias batrachus is confirmed only from the Indonesian island of Java, but three closely related and more widespread species frequently have often been confused with this species. These are C. magur of northeast India and Bangladesh, a likely undescribed species from Indochina, and another likely undescribed species from the Thai-Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, and Borneo.[3][4] Both of these undescribed species have been referred to as, Clarias aff. batrachus.[3] At present, the taxonomic position of the Philippines population (called hito or simply \"catfish\" by the locals) is unclear, and it also is unclear whether South Indian populations are C. magur or another species.[4] As a consequence, much information (behavioral, ecological, related to introduced populations, etc.) listed for C. batrachus, may be for the closely related species that have been confused with true C. batrachus.[4] True C. batrachus, C. magur and the two likely undescribed species are all kept in aquaculture.[4] Walking catfish thrive in stagnant, frequently hypoxic waters,[5] and often are found in muddy ponds, canals, ditches, and similar habitats. The species spends most of its time on, or right above, the bottom, with occasional trips to the surface to gulp air.[5] In the wild, this creature is omnivorous; it feeds on smaller fish, molluscs, and other invertebrates, as well as detritus and aquatic weeds. It is a voracious eater that consumes food supplies rapidly, so it is considered harmful when invasive.[7] Within Asia, this species has been introduced widely.[3] It has also been introduced outside its native range where it is considered an invasive species. It consumes the food supplies of native fish and preys on their young. It also is regarded as an invasive species because they can destroy fish farms. In the United States, it is established in Florida.[8] It is reported in California, Connecticut, Georgia, Massachusetts, and Nevada.  \nThe walking catfish was imported to Florida, reportedly from Thailand, in the early 1960s for the aquaculture trade.[5] The first introductions apparently occurred in the mid-1960s when adult fish imported as brood stock escaped, either from a fish farm in northeastern Broward County or from a truck transporting brood fish between Dade and Broward Counties. Additional introductions in Florida, supposedly purposeful releases, were made by fish farmers in the Tampa Bay area, Hillsborough County in late 1967 or early 1968, after the state banned the importation and possession of walking catfish. Aquarium releases likely are responsible for introductions in other states. Dill and Cordone (1997) reported this species has been sold by tropical fish dealers in California for some time. They also have been spotted occasionally in the Midwest. In Florida, walking catfish are known to have invaded aquaculture farms, entering ponds where they prey on agricultural fish stocks. In response, fish farmers have had to erect fences to protect ponds. Authorities have also created laws that ban possession of walking catfish. In 2017, Clarias spp. were recovered from the River Tonge, near Bolton, Northern England.[9] In Indonesia, it is commonly referred as lele, or when needing distinction; lele jawa or lele kampung, compared to lele dumbo or lele sangkuriang which refers to the introduced C. gariepinus. It is the main ingredient in several traditional dishes, such as pecel lele and mangut lele. In Thailand, Clarias aff. batrachus is known as pla duk dan (Thai: \u0e1b\u0e25\u0e32\u0e14\u0e38\u0e01\u0e14\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19). It is a common, inexpensive food item, prepared in a variety of ways. It often is offered by street vendors, especially grilled or fried.[10] This fish is also one of the most common freshwater catfish in the Philippines, which as aforementioned is known as hito in the local language. Despite this, current evidence of Clarias aff. batrachus populations from other regions of southeast Asia and India in relation towards C. batrachus have not been thoroughly studied.[clarification needed] A white variation with black patterns is commonly seen in the aquarium fish trade. However, this color variation also is prohibited where walking catfish are banned. Very well-rooted plants and large structures that provide some shade should be included in an aquarium with these fish. Any small tankmates will be eaten by this fish."

H. brachysoma is found in smooth flowing areas with much vegetation. Periyar river in Kerala state is the best habitat but now they are commonly seen in the Chalakudy River due to the less disturbed habitats. The population genetic structure of this species has been studied extensively by using genetic markers.[9][10]  This species occupies lowland areas of rivers and backwaters with mud or sand substrate. It has also been recorded in deep pools and hill streams.[2]\nThe diet of H. brachysoma has been studied. It is an unspecialized feeder and eats a variety of meaty foods. Food items include crustaceans, molluscs, and fish. Adults may consume terrestrial insects and even frogs. Stomachs of these fish contain detritus which is indicative of its bottom-feeding habits.[3] This flexible diet is beneficial in its variable habitat, in which food availality is affected by monsoons.[3]  Feeding rate is known to increase during the breeding season in the months following the monsoon season.[3] Spawning occurs before the monsoons and finishes by the southwest monsoon in the summer.[2] H. brachysoma is an important food fish in India and is also sold in the aquarium trade. The IUCN considers H. brachysoma to be a vulnerable species, while other have considered it to be an endangered species.[11] Overexploitation, habitat alteration, pollution and related anthropogenic pressures on their natural habitats have considerably reduced populations of this species by 60\u201370% during the last few years.[3]"

        "description": " Helicophagus hypophthalmus Sauvage, 1878\nPangasius sutchi Fowler, 1937[3]\nPangasius hypophthalmus (Sauvage, 1878) The iridescent shark, iridescent shark catfish[4] (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus) is a species of shark catfish (family Pangasiidae) native to the rivers of Southeast Asia. Despite its name, it is not a shark. It is found in the Mekong basin as well as the Chao Phraya River, and is heavily cultivated for food there. The meat is often marketed under the common name swai (from Thai \u0e2a\u0e27\u0e32\u0e22). It has also been introduced into other river basins as a food source, and its striking appearance and iridescence have made it popular with fishkeeping hobbyists, among whom it is also known as the Siamese shark catfish or sutchi catfish.[5] The swai's omnivorous diet consists of crustaceans, other fish, and plant matter.[6] The fish is named for the glow or iridescence exhibited in juveniles, as well as the shark-like appearance of this and other shark catfish. Adults reach up to 130\u00a0cm (4.3\u00a0ft) in length and can weigh up to a maximum of 44\u00a0kg (97\u00a0lb). They have a shiny, iridescent color that gives these fish their name. However, large adults are uniformly grey. The fins are dark grey or black. Juveniles have a black stripe along the lateral line and a second black stripe below the lateral line.[6] Iridescent sharks originate from the large rivers Chao Phraya and Mekong in Asia, though they have been introduced into other rivers for aquaculture. They are a freshwater fish that natively live in a tropical climate and prefer water with a 6.5\u20137.5 pH, a water hardness of 2.0\u201329 dGH, and a temperature range of 22\u201326\u00a0\u00b0C (72\u201379\u00a0\u00b0F).[6] They can tolerate hypoxic conditions thanks to their swim bladder which can be used as an air-breathing organ.[7] They prefer large bodies of water similar to the deep waters of their native Mekong river basin. The iridescent shark is a migratory fish that in most regions moves upstream to spawn during the flood season while the waters are high and returns downstream to seek rearing habitats when the river water levels recede. The dates of the migrations vary depending on the river system. In the Mekong river basin, they migrate upstream in May to July and return downstream during September through December. South of the Khone Falls, upstream migration occurs in October to February, with its peak in November to December; here, it appears to be triggered by receding waters at the end of the flood season.[6] In August 2015, an environmental group in Santander, Colombia, confirmed that iridescent sharks had been found in one of the tributaries that feed into the Magdalena River, having been accidentally introduced from illegal farm fisheries in the area. The find has caused alarm amongst the scientific community and government officials, as the Magdalena river is home to over 200 native fish species, 35 of which are endangered.[8] Disruption to these sharks can come from many physical stressors, including but not limited to shear forces, rapid decompression, blade strike and turbulence. These can lead to and have led to an increase in the Injury and mortality rate of these sharks. This is a sad reality[citation needed] since these injured can be caused by hydropower developments which are being put into place to combat the global climate crisis that is being faced.[9]\nIridescent sharks are also introduced to other Southeast Asia countries for food, especially Peninsular Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and Myanmar. In Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia they are called ikan patin (which 'ikan' means fish in Malay and Indonesian), Malaysian Chinese prefer them steamed or cooked in whole, while Malay prefer cooking these fishes with Tempoyak and curry.[10] Pangasius does not have a gourmet reputation and is sold cheaply as swai (/swa\u026a/, from Thai \u0e2a\u0e27\u0e32\u0e22 s\u0304w\u0101y)[11][12] in the United States, panga (or pangas) in Europe and cream dory and basa in several Asian countries and in Australia and the UK. Despite its lowly reputation, the total export of pangasius from Vietnam reached US$1.8 billion in 2014.[13] Pangasius fillets are an increasingly popular product because of their low cost, mild taste and firm texture. Recipes for other whitefish such as sole or halibut can be adapted to pangasius.[14] Pangasius is an omnivorous fish, and thus does not require a high level of animal protein in its diet. Typical grading sizes are 3\u20135\u00a0oz (85\u2013140\u00a0g), 5\u20137\u00a0oz (140\u2013200\u00a0g), and 7\u20139\u00a0oz (200\u2013260\u00a0g).[15] While juvenile iridescent sharks are sold as pets for home aquariums, they are not easy fish to keep. Iridescent sharks are schooling fish that prefer groups,[6] are accustomed to living in rivers, and are active fish that require space. They have very poor eyesight, so detected movement from outside of their habitat can be seen as a threat. If stressed, their first instinct is to flee; a blind dash can cause injury in an aquarium environment. These injuries may result in the fish sinking to the bottom, where it may lie on its side or back until it recovers.[16] Iridescent sharks require a minimum tank size of 12\u00a0m (39\u00a0ft) to develop naturally. Schools require even larger tanks. If given enough room and fed adequately, they can reach 1\u00a0m (3.3\u00a0ft) in length. In most home aquaria, the lack of space stunts their growth. For this reason, most iridescent sharks kept in home aquaria grow to  15 to 30\u00a0cm (6 to 12\u00a0in) in length only and may die prematurely. When provided adequately sized aquaria and proper husbandry, iridescent sharks may live into their teens and grow to full size.[17]"

Its populations have declined drastically, mainly due to overfishing, and it is now considered Critically Endangered.[1] The specific name sanitwongsei was chosen to honor M. R. Suwaphan Sanitwong (Thai: \u0e21.\u0e23.\u0e27.\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e27\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e23\u0e13 \u0e2a\u0e19\u0e34\u0e17\u0e27\u0e07\u0e28\u0e4c) for his support of fisheries in Thailand.[2] The species is native to the Mekong and Chao Phraya rivers that run through China, Cambodia, Thailand, Viet Nam, and the Lao People's Democratic Republic. It has been introduced to central Anatolia,[3] South Africa,[4] and Malaysia.[5] The Pangasius sanitwongsei is tolerant of poor quality water,[4] mainly in brackish waters, and prefers to live in the bottom of deep depressions in freshwater rivers.[6][failed verification] The fish live in rivers but are experiencing endangerment due to dams being built, causing the fish to be trapped and unable to migrate.[7] There are currently two sub-populations of Paroon Shark separated by the Khone Falls which they do not migrate over.[8] The Giant Pangasius is a ray-finned fish part of the family Pangasiidae commonly known as Shark Catfishes. They are recognized for having both dorsal and ventral long fins, which help stabilize the fish and keep it upright.[9] This adds to their bilateral symmetry corresponding to their developed swimming ability. Its skin is pigmented with dusky melanophores that help with camouflage in bottom waters. It has a wide, flat, whiskerless head. Its body is compressed and elongate, with a depressed head.[10] It has a continuous and uninterrupted single vomero-palatine teeth patch which is curved.[11] The anal fin has 26 rays and the pectoral spine is similar in size to the dorsal spine and also shows serrations.[10] It has a silver, curved underside and a dark brown back.  Its dorsal, pectoral and pelvic fins are dark gray and the first soft ray is extended into a filament. Its dorsal, adipose, pectoral, and caudal fins are a dark grey to black coloring, with its anal fin and pelvic fins a white to grey coloring.[4] Full-grown adults can reach 300 centimetres (9.8\u00a0ft) SL in length and weigh up to 300\u00a0kg (660\u00a0lb).[12] More commonly the fish's length is around 2 meters.[6] Little is known of the reproduction of P. sanitwongsei, but the time of spawning happens in the months of April and May.[6] It is predicted that spawning happens in the rivers where they are found; they are not believed to be migrating from outside the river when getting ready to spawn.[13] Eggs and sperm are usually released in a muddier area to prevent eggs from sticking to each other.[14] The number of eggs per each spawning is around 600 (with a diameter of 2-2.5mm) and the brood shows low genetic variation.[6] There is no parental care after spawning.[15] The giant pangasius is a benthopelagic and migratory species. Juveniles and adults feed on crustaceans and fishes. These fish typically spawn just prior to the monsoon season.[12] It is believed that the P. sanitwongsei prey on shrimp, crabs, and fish and hideout in deep areas in rivers.[6] The P. sanitwongsei have a seasonal migration but the fish does not leave the river during its migration, it only stays within the river during the seasonal migration.[16] The P. sanitwongsei is a carnivorous fish, whose prey consist of shrimp, crabs, and fish.[6] Since the fish lives on the bottom, it is also known to feed on larger animals' carcasses.[4] Due to it being both an apex predator and a bottom-dwelling fish, it limits the populations of smaller fish as many catfish species. This fish's lifespan isn't known, but it is known that it grows fast[4] and usually the trend is when it grows fast, it dies quickly.[citation needed] The possible reasoning for this could be the fact that there is over-fishing of the species.[3] The P. sanitwongsei's role in the ecosystem is the top predator, therefore inflicts top down control on the population. Top predators aid in the limitation of smaller organisms and in this case they prey on smaller fish keeping the smaller fish in check. Without these carnivorous predators, the smaller fish could overpopulate and throw the food chain into imbalance.[17]  Due to overharvesting, the native fish population may increase since the P. sanitwongsei population is declining.[18] This fish is important to many locals that reside in the regions where the rivers run through as this is an important food source. Many fishing villages rely on the organisms that reside in the river to provide food for their family as well as a source of income as they can sell them at markets. Due to this fish's large known range, it can show us migratory pathways and spawning habits and areas that should be protected, and other areas that can be harvested.[6] This species of fish is also important to fisheries as it can grow to large sizes, even in captivity, and build an economy that relies heavily on fish and other water species. This was a significant reason why it was introduced to rivers in South Africa.[4] These fishes are also valuable asset in the pet trade. They are considered exotic organisms as they are not commonly found in aquariums and are not domesticated. This introduced species in South African rivers can also be a case of release from aquariums once they could no longer be contained due to their high energy need and large size.[4] Fishing of this species used to be accompanied by religious ceremonies and rites. It is often mentioned in textbooks, news media, and popular press. This fish is a popular food fish and marketed fresh.[12] They were introduced to Malaysia for both food and as an ornamental fish. These fish sometimes appear in the aquarium fish hobby. Most specimens do not reach their full size without an extremely large aquarium or pond. There is even a \"balloon\" form of this fish where the fish has an unusually short and stocky body.[19] In addition to fishing for religious purposes, they are also hunted for sport as they are the largest of their kind. They are considered trophy fish and are hunted for prestige and fame. The downside is that these individuals are the most fecund and mature which leads to a decrease in population if too many are harvested at one time. This further makes them a topic of conservation as they play key roles in their ecosystem.[20] This fish is highly protected and has a high conservation value and is banned from being fished through all seasons.[21] The fish is being threatened by overharvesting, damming of rivers, and pollution. Their population continues to decline as there are not many legislations and enforcement toward this species. A common threat to these large organisms is dams and segmentation of the Mekong River. The Paroon shark travels upstream to spawn and resides downstream. The construction of dams leads to segmentation of the natural habitat.[22] Even though the bodies of water are interconnected these fish are not capable of swimming through walls to get to their natural breeding sites. Aside from being threatened by anthropogenic causes, the Giant Pangasius is considered an umbrella species in conservation. Protecting this species would provide protection for species that inhabit the same region. With this tactic, a whole ecosystem can be preserved. Due to this area being an area that is highly fished commercially and locally, certain regulations can be put in place to manage the size of the fish that can be caught allowing mature adults to reproduce with greater success. [23] A known breeding practice, to try and help the population, is being practiced by the Thai government.[6] A halt on harvesting has been recommended until the P. sanitwongsei's population can rise to a safe level.[6] Even though these fish are grown in a safe fishery, this can reduce the genetic diversity between them making them more susceptible to disease as well as environmental stress. To control the amount of overharvesting (via fishing) that occurs certain size and catch limits can be put in place. In 1989, the Paroon shark was listed as a class II protected species by the government of Yunnan, China.[8] The issue is that the habitat of this species lies in multiple countries' domains including Cambodia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Thailand, and Viet Nam. Restrictions in parts of the river that reside in China's territory, leave the other parts to be unprotected. There are some groups in the Asian continent who have been trying to protect and conserve the wildlife in these regions including the Asian Species Action Partnership (ASAP), Species Survival Commission (SSC), World Wildlife Fund (WWF), and International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN).[24]"

It may also be called Southern striped Raphael, talking catfish, chocolate doradid, chocolate catfish or thorny catfish.[1] It is native to the Amazon, Paraguay\u2013Paran\u00e1 and lower Orinoco basins in South America.[2] This peaceful, nocturnal species is a popular aquarium fish due to its pleasant temperament and curious nature.[3] Despite its name \"talking catfish\", it does not speak. This catfish has long been confused with Platydoras costatus of Suriname and French Guiana, where the pale stripe on the body does not extend onto the head.[2] These fish burrow in the soft river bottoms and frequently occurs on sandy bottoms.[4] These fish feed on mollusks, crustaceans and organic debris.[4] They have rigid pectoral fin spines. The striped Raphael catfish also has tiny and curved protective spines running along its body. The typically reported maximum standard length of this species is 20\u201324\u00a0cm (7.9\u20139.4\u00a0in).[5][6] Considerably larger individuals, up to 43\u00a0cm (17\u00a0in) long, have been reported from the Tocantins\u2013Araguaia basin,[4][7] but this population, together with those from the Tapaj\u00f3s and Xingu, likely represent an undescribed species (not to be confused with P. birindellii, a species from the Xingu basin that was described in 2018).[2][8] Juvenile striped raphael catfish have been recorded cleaning piscivorous fish such as Hoplias cf. malabaricus. The stripe pattern in the young may serve as a signal that allows for its recognition as a cleaner. It is noted that the striping pattern is not as strong in adults, and so the cleaning behavior is probably only seen in juveniles.[9] The striped Raphael catfish is a fine and sociable community fish that are peaceful to fellow catfishes and other fish species.[3] However, they are nocturnal, and are usually not visible during the day.[3] It is best not to catch the striped Raphael catfish with a fish net because they are prone to sticking out their pectoral fin spines in a very rigid manner, especially if stressed. Untangling these spines from a net is difficult and dangerous to both handler and fish. Alternative methods should be used.\nAlthough known as a spawning fish, sexual differences are unknown and there have been no reports of being successfully bred in captivity.[3] Because of this, these fish must be wild-caught, and therefore related species of similar appearance sometimes appear in the hobby, such as Orinocodoras eigenmanni, which differs in a longer snout.[3]\nThe Raphael catfish will make some grunting/squeaking noises while out of water.\nAlthough generally sociable with other fish, sometimes this fish can feed on smaller fish so take care when introducing one to an established tank."

It is native to the Rio Negro and Orinoco  basins in Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela,[1][2] where mostly found in slow-moving waters with many submerged structures.[3] It is currently the only recognized species of the genus Asterophysus,[4] but a specimen that possibly represents an undescribed species has been collected in Maraj\u00f3 (about 1,200\u00a0km or 750\u00a0mi from the traditionally recognized range of A. batrachus).[5] The gulper catfish grows to a standard length of 25\u00a0cm (9.8\u00a0in),[1] and a total length of 28.5\u00a0cm (11.2\u00a0in).[6] It has a short, thick-set shape and is dark-colored with a whitish belly.[6] People in its native range typically will not eat it because they consider it very ugly,[7] but it is sometimes kept in aquariums.[8] The gulper catfish is a strict carnivore and swallows its prey, mostly other fish, whole. This prey can be exceptionally large for its size, sometimes even larger than the gulper catfish itself,[8] although such feeding attempts can be unsuccessful.[3] The catfish catches prey by biting on the head. Escaping out of the mouth is generally prevented by the fine, backwards-pointing teeth of the catfish. Instead the struggles of the prey cause it to be further engulfed and eventually ending up folded (with both its head and tail pointing towards the predator's head) in the greatly extendable gulper catfish stomach.[6][9] The fully extended stomach may result in an abnormal appearance of the gulper catfish to the point where its swimming can be impaired. It may also swallow large amounts of water only to expel it later along with remains of earlier prey.[6] Potential prey fish are apparently unable to recognize the gulper catfish as dangerous because fish will not generally consider other fish of roughly similar size as a major threat, and because of its slow, unobtrusive approach.[6][9] A common observed attack is the catfish quickly turning to the side and biting on the head of the targeted fish. Even if the first attempt fails, the gulper catfish will not try to pursue it. The prey will typically still not realize that the catfish represents a threat and can be caught using the same approach.[6] Another method of catching prey was observed by a snorkeler in the Atabapo River. Here the gulper catfish live in crevices between rocks and dart out to catch passing prey such as angelfish.[10] In aquariums gulper catfish will feed during both day and night, but it is suspected the species is nocturnal and crepuscular in the wild, giving it an additional advantage when hunting along river banks for its often sleeping prey.[6]"

        "description": " The emerald catfish  (Corydoras splendens) is a tropical freshwater fish belonging to the Corydoradinae sub-family of the family Callichthyidae native to the Amazon Basin in South America.[1] It has traditionally been known as Brochis splendens.[2] The fish has appeared on a stamp in Brazil.[3] It was originally described as Callichthys splendens by Fran\u00e7ois Louis de la Porte, comte de Castelnau in 1855.  This species was once also commonly called Brochis coeruleus. W. A. Gosline was the first to suspect that the two species were the same in 1940, but it was actually Njiseen & Isbr\u00fccker, in 1970, who combined the two, giving sufficient reasons for doing so. The species would be described as Brochis splendens, until most of the catfish formerly classified as Brochis were re-classified into Corydoras.[2] The current recognized classification is thus Corydoras splendens.[1] It is native to the upper reaches Amazon Basin.[1] This includes Ucayali River to Pucallpa, Ambiyacu River, and the area around Iquitos in western Brazil, southeastern Colombia, eastern Ecuador and eastern Peru. Depending upon the angle of lighting, the fish's body reflects a metallic green, blue-green, or even a bluish color.  The ventral area is yellowish with the pectoral, ventral, and anal fins yellowish and the dorsal, caudal, and adipose fins a translucent brownish.  The females are larger and more robust than the males, and have a more pinkish belly as opposed to the more yellowish one for the males. This fish can be distinguished from the green/bronze corydoras catfish by its usually larger size, stouter body, and more pointed snout. The fish inhabits sluggish waters with dense vegetation along the banks.[1] It occurs in shallow muddy waters and will grow in length up to 7.5\u00a0centimetres (3\u00a0in).[1] It lives in a tropical climate in water with a 5.8\u20138.0 pH, a water hardness of 2\u201330 dGH, and a temperature range of 22\u201328\u00a0\u00b0C (72\u201382\u00a0\u00b0F).[1] It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, and insect larvae. It lays eggs in dense vegetation and adults do not guard the eggs. The emerald catfish is a common species in freshwater aquaria.  It is a peaceful, undemanding species and can be maintained under the same conditions as most Corydoras species.  They are shy and easily frightened when kept as individuals, so it is best kept in small groups of at least three, with more being recommended.  The tank should have only a soft, fine bottom to prevent damage to barbels and should be heavily planted.[4] Feeding is not difficult and they accept almost anything, although live worms are especially appreciated.[5] It does well in a community tank and does not tear up the plants.[5] Spawning has been achieved in captivity.[4] Typically, the fish are separated into a breeding tank in the ratio of three males to two females, all well-conditioned on live foods.  The couple will spawn while sitting on the bottom, not while swimming as many similar species do. In captivity, the female collects the eggs in her pelvic fin basket and pastes them individually to plants and other objects.  Eggs will be deposited by the female throughout the tank, but especially on any floating surface plants.  According to most reports, the parents do not immediately try to eat the eggs.  The eggs hatch in about four days and the fry become free swimming two days later."

It is native to South America, and is found in the western Amazon basin in Ecuador and Peru. This species is traditionally placed in Brochis but the genus is a synonym of Corydoras.[1][2] FishBase continues to recognize Brochis as a valid genus.[3] The fish has about 17 dorsal fin rays as compared with the 11 or 12 commonly seen in Corydoras splendens. The snout is considerably longer than other species in the genus which explains the common name. The fish will grow in length up to 6.7 centimetres (2.6 inches).[citation needed] The hog-nosed catfish lives in a tropical climate in water with a 6.0\u20137.2 pH, a water hardness of 15 dGH, and a temperature range of 21\u201324\u00a0\u00b0C (70\u201375\u00a0\u00b0F).

        "description": " The banded corydoras or bearded catfish (Scleromystax barbatus) is a subtropical freshwater fish belonging to the subfamily Corydoradinae of the family Callichthyidae. It originates in coastal drainages in South America from Rio de Janeiro to Santa Catarina, Brazil.[2] It was originally described as Callichthys barbatus by Jean Ren\u00e9 Constant Quoy & Joseph Paul Gaimard in 1824, from which it was transferred to genus Corydoras as Corydoras barbatus, a name which by which it is still being referred to in the aquarium industry. The species was further transferred to genus Scleromystax in 2003.[3] The fish will grow in length up to 9.8\u00a0centimetres (3.9\u00a0in).[2] This species has pronounced sexual dimorphism. The dorsal and pectoral fins of males reach, or almost reach, the caudal peduncle, and well-developed odontodes are inserted in fleshy tissue on a large area on the sides of the snout in fully grown males.[4] The banded corydoras lives in a subtropical climate in water with a 6.0\u20138.0 pH, a water hardness of 2\u201325 dGH, and a temperature of 68\u00a0\u00b0F (20\u00a0\u00b0C) to 82\u00a0\u00b0F (28\u00a0\u00b0C).[2] It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. It lays eggs in dense vegetation and adults do not guard the eggs. In captivity, as the sperm are released the female sinks to the bottom, resting on one of her pectoral fins while she starts fanning with the other pectoral fin. At this time, some eggs are released which fall into the pelvic fin basket and are apparently fertilized at that time. The banded corydoras is of commercial importance in the aquarium trade industry. Though peaceful, they get larger than most Corydoras and are therefore less suitable for small aquaria.[5]  This Callichthyidae-related article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it."

The specific epithet melanistius means black sail, referring to the dorsal fin. The fish will grow in length up to 5.1 centimetres (2.0 inches). It lives in a tropical climate in water with pH 6.0 - 8.0, a water hardness of 2 \u2013 25 dGH, and a temperature range of 22\u201326\u00a0\u00b0C (72\u201379\u00a0\u00b0F). It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. It lays eggs in dense vegetation and adults do not guard the eggs. The female holds 2\u20134 eggs between her pelvic fins, where the male fertilizes them for about 30 seconds. Only then does the female swim to a suitable spot, where she attaches the very sticky eggs. The pair repeats this process until about 100 eggs have been fertilized and attached.

        "description": " The bronze corydoras  (Corydoras aeneus), also known as the green corydoras, bronze catfish, lightspot corydoras or wavy catfish, is a species of freshwater fish in the armored catfish family, Callichthyidae, often kept as an aquarium fish. It is widely distributed in South America on the eastern side of the Andes, from Colombia and Trinidad to the R\u00edo de la Plata basin;[2] however, as presently defined it is a species complex and a taxonomic review is necessary.[3] It was originally described as Hoplosoma aeneum (based on a specimen from Trinidad) by Theodore Gill in 1858 and has historically also been referred to as Callichthys aeneus.[2] The adult size is 6\u00bd cm for males and a slightly larger 7\u00a0cm for females (2\u00bd to 2\u00be inches).[4]   Females have a slightly higher body frame than males in accordance with their larger abdominal region. Their average life span is 10 years. It has a yellow or pink body, white belly, and is blue-grey over its head and back. Its fins are yellow or pink and immaculate. In common with most Corydoras the dorsal, pectoral and adipose fins have an additional sharp barb and have a mild poison which causes fish which try to attack them to get stung. A brownish-orange patch is usually present on the head, just before the dorsal fin, and is its most distinctive feature when viewed from above in the stream. Their upper sides are often a greenish color, which is the reason another common name for this fish is the green corydoras. Like many other catfishes, females are larger than males in this species.[5] They are found in quiet, shallow waters with soft bottoms that can sometimes be heavily polluted by clouds of disturbed mud from the bottom, but it also inhabits running waters.[2] In its native habitat, it inhabits waters with a temperature range of 25\u00a0\u00b0C to 28\u00a0\u00b0C (77\u00a0\u00b0F to 82\u00a0\u00b0F), pH 6.0\u20138.0, and hardness 5 to 19 DGH.[2] Like most members of the genus Corydoras, these catfish have a unique method of coping with the low oxygen content that prevails in such environments. In addition to utilizing their gills like any other fish, they rapidly come to the surface of the water and draw air in through their mouth. This air is then absorbed through the wall of the intestine and any surplus air is expelled through the vent.[2] It typically stays in schools of 20 to 30 individuals.[2] It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter.[2] Reproduction occurs with the onset of the rainy season, which changes the water chemistry.[2] Females spawn 10\u201320 egg-clutches with multiple males at a time, but an entire egg clutch is inseminated by the sperm of a single male.[5] In laboratory observations, it was found that bronze corydoras have a unique method of insemination. When these fish reproduce, the male will present his abdomen to the female. The female will attach her mouth to the male's genital opening, creating the well-known \"T-position\" many Corydoras exhibit during courtship. The female will then drink the sperm. The sperm rapidly moves through her intestines and is discharged together with her eggs into a pouch formed by her pelvic fins. The female can then swim away and deposit the pouch somewhere else alone. Because the T-position is exhibited in other species than just C. aeneus, it is likely that they also exhibit this behavior.[6] In the wild, eggs are laid on waterweeds.[5] Males do not form territories or compete over females; interference between males might only happen when two males present their abdomens simultaneously. On the other hand, females do not choose between males. Mating is more or less random; therefore, male reproductive success is directly related to courtship frequency.[5] The eggs of C. aeneus exhibit a unique surface pattern with small villi-like protuberances which resemble attaching-filaments of teleost eggs. These structures allow the eggs to be adhesive and stick to a specific place or to each other. The presence of these structures may be related to the turbid habitat in which this species lives.[7] Bronze corydoras are probably the most popular Corydoras species.[8] It is annually bred and shipped in large quantities all over the world[9] It is easily bred and is produced in commercial quantities in the United States, Europe, and Singapore. Most of the available fish are therefore domestic strains. Wild imports are reported to be less easy to breed.[citation needed] They are a hardy and useful aquarium fish despite having a coloration that is by no means striking or unusual. Many aquarists are fascinated by the habits of these fish. They ceaselessly comb the bottom of the aquarium for food and therefore disturb it slightly, sending up detritus and waste material that has settled loosely on the bottom. They prefer being kept in groups of 5 or more, being sociable fish and are ideal fish for a community tank.[2] Other Corydoras species can be placed in the same aquarium, and despite the strong resemblance many species bear to one another, the species will tend to separate out and only move about among their own kind. Corydoras aeneus is not particular about the composition of the water. Adequate conditions are a temperature range of 20 to 28\u00a0\u00b0C (68 to 82\u00a0\u00b0F), pH of 6.0\u20138.0, and hardness of 2\u201330 DGH. The water should have no salt added to it.[8] A fairly dense growth of plants with a number of possible hiding places is greatly appreciated. Corys are easy to feed, they are omnivores eating all flake and pelleted food and also live and frozen foods. When it comes to sperm, then the female glues the eggs, only a few in number, to the chosen substrate and then (sometimes) quickly touches them with her mouth. After several acts of spawning, which span a total of two to three hours, one female will have produced up to 200 eggs. Frequently, two males are used for each female, as one male has difficulty fertilizing all the eggs. The eggs gradually grow darker in color, and just prior to hatching (ranging from three days at 28\u00a0\u00b0C to a week at 20\u00a0\u00b0C) they turn dark brown. The fry keep to the bottom of the tank, feeding on detritus and any fine foods available. The parents may spawn again within two to three weeks. The albino corydoras is an albino variety of the bronze corydoras that has been developed for the aquarium trade, with a pale pink or orange body and red eyes.  It is physically similar to normally-colored individuals, although some breeders report that the fry are a little slower to develop.[10] Others say that the albinos are practically blind and that the males are somewhat sterile, although this may be due to extensive inbreeding.[11] Albino bronze corydoras are frequently injected with bright dye (via a needle) and sold in aquariums. This controversial practice is known as \"painting\" or \"juicing\" fish."

        "description": " The dwarf corydoras (Corydoras hastatus), dwarf catfish, tail spot pygmy catfish, or micro catfish is a tropical freshwater fish belonging to the subfamily Corydoradinae of the family Callichthyidae.  It originates in inland waters in South America, and is found in the Amazon River and Paraguay River basins in Argentina, Bolivia, and Brazil.[1] The specific epithet hastatus means with a spear, in reference to the spearhead-like spot on the tail root. The body of Corydoras hastatus is typically more elongated than other Corydoras species.  Its body is a translucent white to olive color, with a thin dark stripe on the sides from behind the gill cover to the root of the tail, and a whitish belly.  It has a white crescent at the base of the tail surrounding a black spot.  The fish will grow in length up to 1.4 inches (3.5\u00a0cm), but 1.0 inch (2.5\u00a0cm) is more typical.  Males are smaller, more slender and have a more pointed dorsal fin than females. The dwarf corydoras lives in a (sub)tropical climate in water with a 6.0\u20138.0 pH, a water hardness of 5\u201319 dGH, and a temperature range of 68\u201382 F (20\u201328\u00a0\u00b0C).[1] It is found in ponds.[1] It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. They are found in the Paraguay River and Amazon River basins. C. hastatus lives among plants.[1] It is a schooling species.[1] It differs from most Corydoras species by preferring the midwater areas instead of the bottom, spending most of its time well off the bottom in areas of dense plants.  When it rests, it rests on the leaves of the plants.  Other Corydoras species with similar mid-water habits include C. habrosus and C. pygmaeus. The dwarf Corydoras maintains its position in a current by using rapid fin movements, especially with its pectoral fins. These rapid movements, combined with a high breathing rate, give the fish the appearance of being very \"nervous\" when compared with other fish. C. hastatus may even shoal with small characins. The fish lays its eggs in dense vegetation and the adults do not guard the eggs.  The female holds a single egg between her pelvic fins, where the male fertilizes them for about 30 seconds.  Only then does the female swim to a suitable spot, where she attaches the sticky egg. The pair repeats this process about every three minutes for from one to two hours with some 10- to 15-minute rests between egg releases.  Around 7 to 15 eggs are spawned in a single day, and spawning occurs on three to four consecutive days. A total of 30 to 60 eggs may be spawned by a single female over this period of time. The eggs hatch in three to nine days.  The fry are about 6\u00a0mm long at hatching, mostly translucent but sometimes with spots. In two months, the fry average about 18\u00a0mm in length.  The fry mature in six to eight months. The dwarf corydoras is of commercial importance in the aquarium trade industry.   Due to its small size, this fish can be kept in a relatively small aquarium; a 5-gallon (20 litre) tank is sufficient for a small school.  Since it is a schooling fish, it should only be kept in groups of at least six individuals.  It is a good community tank fish when kept with peaceful tankmates such as tetras, rasboras, and danios, but should not be kept with overly aggressive tankmates.  They have also been used as scavengers for fry tanks. The aquarium should be clean, well-aerated, and densely planted to provide hiding places.  A moderate current provided by a power filter or canister filter is appreciated.  The water should be slightly alkaline (pH about 7.6) within a temperature range of 24\u00b0 to 29\u00a0\u00b0C.  Although the fish is generally a mid-water dweller, a fine gravel or sand substrate should be provided since it will occasionally burrow. The fish will feed both in midwater or on a substrate, whether that substrate is a plant leaf, a broad rock, or the bottom of the tank.  It accepts most foods, including freeze-dried, flake, and frozen foods, although live foods are particularly appreciated. The methods of spawning this fish in the aquarium is similar to spawning most other Corydoras species.  The spawning tank can be as small as 2.5 gallons (10 L), but at least a 5-gallon (20 L) tank is recommended with aged water, a sponge filter and some plants.  Fish should be conditioned with large amounts of live foods such as Tubifex and whiteworms, during which time the females will become noticeably plumper.  Since C. hastatus may spawn as a school, the whole group can be conditioned for spawning at the same time, and for best results, there should be at least two males for every female. Spawning of well-conditioned fish may be initiated by the addition of cooler water.  During spawning, very little food is accepted, but the fish will immediately search for food after finishing.  It will typically attach its eggs to the plants in the aquarium, but if not enough plants are available, the sides of the aquarium may be used.  When the fry hatch, they can be fed newly hatched brine shrimp or microworms.  The parents may be ready to spawn again in a couple of weeks."

The fish's appearance is characterized by dark double longitudinal stripes. The dorsal fin is ornamented by a few gray dots, taking on an arching pattern in some individuals. The body has other gray and black markings on an olive background. Compared with other species of Corydoras, the body is not as tall in comparison to its length, and its eyes are set a bit lower. The fish will grow in length up to 5.1 centimetres (2.0 inches). It lives in a tropical climate in water with a 6.0 - 8.0 pH, a water hardness of 2 \u2013 25 dGH, and a temperature range of 22\u201326\u00a0\u00b0C (72\u201379\u00a0\u00b0F). It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. Though it lays eggs in dense vegetation, adults do not guard them. In captivity, the male is reportedly territorial during the prespawning activities while the female is usually hidden among the plant roots. Both sexes clean the underside of plant leaves. Eggs are fastened under the leaves and are also attached to roots of plants. The elegant corydoras is of commercial importance in the aquarium trade industry. It tends to swim in the upper levels of the aquarium, instead of at the bottom as is common with most species of Corydoras, and does not seem to disturb the sediment as much."

It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter.  It lays eggs in dense vegetation and adults do not guard the eggs.  The female holds 2\u20134 eggs between her pelvic fins, where the male fertilizes them for about 30 seconds.  Only then does the female swim to a suitable spot, where she attaches the very sticky eggs. The pair repeats this process until about 100 eggs have been fertilized and attached. The reticulated corydoras is of commercial importance in the aquarium trade industry.  This Callichthyidae-related article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it."

        "description": " Corydoras panda is a species of catfish belonging to the genus Corydoras, of the family Callichthyidae, and is a native member of the riverine fauna of South America.  It is found in Peru and Ecuador, most notably in the Hu\u00e1nuco region, where it inhabits the R\u00edo Aquas, the R\u00edo Amarillae, a tributary of the R\u00edo Pachitea, and the R\u00edo Ucayali river system. The species was first collected by Randolph H. Richards in 1968, and was named Corydoras panda by Nijssen and Isbr\u00fccker in 1971. The specific name is an allusion to the appearance of the fish, which possesses large black patches surrounding the eyes, reminiscent of those found on the giant panda. Accordingly, the common names for this fish, which is a popular aquarium species, are panda corydoras and panda catfish. Corydoras panda has an off-white to pinkish-orange ground colour, and when observed under certain lighting conditions, a faint greenish iridescence is present upon the flanks and the operculum. The fins of the fish match the body in ground colour, upon close inspection being seen to be hyaline or translucent with coloured fin rays, with the dorsal fin being marked by a conspicuous black blotch that covers almost the entire fin area. The caudal peduncle is marked with a black band, this black band encircling the caudal peduncle from dorsal to ventral surface. The adipose fin, supported by a small fin spine, sometimes contains black pigmentation. The head is the same ground colour as the body, with a black mask surrounding the eyes, descending vertically from the fontanel, over each eye, and ending in a triangular wedge immediately before the ventral surface of the head. The pectoral fins are positioned immediately behind the operculum, and are usually oriented horizontally when the fish is at rest, extended in a manner similar to the wings of an aeroplane. The pelvic fins are positioned upon the ventral surface of the fish, located some way behind the pectoral fins. The first ray of the dorsal fin emanates from the body at approximately its point of greatest elevation, and a vertical line drawn downwards from this point meets the attachment point of the pelvic fins. The anal fin is located far to the rear of the ventral surface of the body, the attachment point of the first fin ray being somewhat forward of the black caudal peduncle marking described above. In common with all other members of the family Callichthyidae, the body surface is covered, not with scales, but with bony plates known as scutes. The lines of demarcation between individual scutes can be seen upon close examination of this and almost all other Callichthyid fishes, and in the case of some specimens of this species, are highlighted by additional black pigment. The fish possesses, in common with almost all Corydoras species, three pairs of barbels\u2014one pair of maxillary barbels and two pairs of rictal barbels. A fully mature adult specimen of this species attains a standard length of 55 millimetres (2.1\u00a0inches): this is the length attained by mature females, which grow larger than mature males, and also possess more rounded body outlines. Corydoras panda inhabits clear river waters that are relatively fast-flowing, well-oxygenated, and flowing over substrates that may comprise soft sand or fine gravel. These rivers are usually well vegetated with assorted species of aquatic plants. The proximity of the home rivers of the fish to the Andes mountain range, and the replenishment of those rivers with meltwaters from Andean snows at higher altitudes, has led the fish to be adaptable to cooler temperatures than the norm for 'tropical' fishes\u2014the temperature range of the fish is 16\u00a0\u00b0C to 28\u00a0\u00b0C, though the fish exhibits a marked preference for the cooler regions of this temperature spectrum, particularly in captivity. Indeed, the fish can, for small time-periods, survive temperatures as low as 12\u00a0\u00b0C, though captive rearing at such low temperatures is ill-advised. The native waters of Corydoras panda are consequently mineral-deficient, with a neutral to slightly acid pH, and replication of such conditions in captivity are recommended for successful maintenance. Corydoras panda has a preference for cooler than normal waters when compared to many other popular tropical fish species. Because of this, those who keep C. panda in community aquarium setting must choose tankmates that share its preference for cooler temperatures of around 20\u00a0\u00b0C (68\u00a0\u00b0F) to 25\u00a0\u00b0C (77\u00a0\u00b0F).[2] Given the cleanliness of the fish's native waters, scrupulous attention to water quality in the aquarium is considerably more important for this fish than for the more domesticated Corydoras species such as C. paleatus or C. aeneus. Additionally, scrupulous attention to aquarium substrate cleanliness is a must, as the fish are intolerant of poor aquarium maintenance in this area, and succumb to stress and disease rapidly if their aquaria are not kept to a high standard. Despite this, the species remains highly popular with aquarists, upon account of the appearance of the fish, and its lively, vivacious behaviour in a well-planned aquarium setting. Like many other Corydoras species, the panda catfish is a highly gregarious fish, and in common with several other smaller Corydoras species such as C. habrosus and C. pygmaeus, manifests a distinct need for numerous companions of its own species in order to thrive, and can thus be described as being more avowedly social than some of the larger members of the genus. A minimum of eight individuals should be housed in the same aquarium, and if space permits, this number should be revised upwards, as the fish exhibits a very definite preference for grouping together with others of its species. They also associate themselves easily with the clown loach and school together in currents where sufficient numbers of their own species is lacking. An aquarium for this species should be well furnished, ideally with a mixture of live aquatic plants, and solid furnishings providing caves, sheltered areas and hiding places to give the fish security. Floating plants to provide additional areas of shade are also welcomed by the fish. Like all Corydoras species, the fish feeds primarily upon animal matter. The aquarist is advised, however, that the traditional use of Corydoras catfishes as putative 'scavengers' in an aquarium setting will be detrimental to the well-being of this species\u2014it requires high quality foods for long-term maintenance, and a varied diet. Ideally, the fish should be given live foods at least intermittently, and will dine enthusiastically upon such items as Bloodworms (larvae of Chironomus midges), Daphnia, cultivated Brine Shrimp (Atermia salina), and Tubifex worms. The last, however, should be cultivated in order to minimise the risk of introducing pathogenic organisms to the aquarium, as Tubifex live in unsanitary conditions in the wild. Freeze dried Tubifex may be preferable, as the risk of introduction of disease is eliminated. High quality flake foods are also appreciated, particularly those containing shrimp or other similar matter. The lifespan of Corydoras panda in the aquarium has not been systematically determined, but given the longevity of other Corydoras species in the aquarium, it is reasonable to assume that well-cared for specimens will enjoy a lifespan in excess of ten years, and frequently in excess of 15 years. Corydoras panda follows, with a few minor deviations, the standard model for breeding for the genus. Stimulus for breeding consists of the influx of cooler, oxygenated waters into their habitat, usually corresponding in the wild with the onset of the rainy season. However, while some Corydoras species require a temperature drop in the aquarium for spawning to be stimulated, in the case of Corydoras panda, the temperature drop appears to matter much less, as specimens have spawned in the aquarium without a temperature drop. The addition of new, clean, oxygenated water appears to be the primary stimulus for this species. In the wild, the appearance of new water courtesy of the rains is followed by an increase in the populations of assorted food organisms, and feeding upon these conditions the fishes for breeding. Once conditioned fish are stimulated into spawning, males begin chasing females energetically. Females begin developing eggs within their reproductive tracts, and when 'ripe' (laden with eggs), become receptive to the attentions of the males. Eventually, one male will succeed in courting a female, using his barbels to provide stimulation to the female, usually beginning with caresses of the female's caudal peduncle, followed by caresses of the fontanel and the front of the head. if the female is receptive, then the male positions himself before the female, so that the female's mouth is in close proximity with one of the male's pectoral fins. The male then clasps the female's barbels between the pectoral fin and the body, and this stimulates the female to press against the male's side. When seen from above, the fish form a 'T' shape when conjoined thus, hence the term 'T position' has become conventional in aquarium circles when describing the breeding of Corydoras catfishes. Once the male and female are in the 'T position', the pressing of the female against the male's body stimulates his release of sperm. Though the exact mechanism of fertilisation has yet to be scientifically documented, from the observations of aquarists who have been successful in breeding Corydoras catfishes, it seems likely that the female takes the male's sperm through her mouthparts, and directs them through the gills, in a current that carries the sperm to her pelvic fins. At this point, the female releases a single egg (occasionally two), and purses her pelvic fins in order to provide a receptacle for the freshly extruded egg, which is then fertilised. One difference observed between the adoption of the 'T position' in Corydoras panda, when compared to other Corydoras species, is that the exercise is frequently more acrobatic in appearance, with the 'T position' being adopted in mid-water, some distance above the substrate, rather than resting upon the substrate as is the case with the majority of other Corydoras. Once the female is carrying a fertilised egg within her pelvic fins, she then seeks an egg deposition site. The choice of such a site is frequently, though not always, a mass of fine leaved aquatic vegetation. In the aquarium, the plant known as Java moss, Vesicularia dubayana, is of considerable utility as an egg repository for Corydoras catfishes, even though the plant is not a South American native, and panda catfish females will choose large clumps of this plant readily as safe deposition sites for fertilised eggs. The female is frequently pursued by one or more males as she seeks the deposition site, each male presumably seeking to be the chosen mate to fertilise the next egg. Up to 25 eggs may be produced by a single female during a single spawning, which may take place over four to five hours. Fertile Corydoras panda eggs require approximately 3\u20134 days development time before hatching, if kept at a temperature of 22\u00a0\u00b0C. This development time will vary with temperature, taking longer in cooler water. Upon hatching, the fry are four millimetres long, translucent, but already possessing the basic ground colour of the species, and upon close examination, possess fully formed barbels. Even newly hatched fry possess at least some hint of the adult eye patches, and as the fry grow, these patches darken and become more prominent. Even so, at just four millimetres in length, the fry are practically invisible against typical aquarium gravel unless seen to move. The fry take approximately four weeks to develop to the point where the finfold, a continuous undifferentiated membrane resembling that seen at the posterior of a tadpole, has differentiated into the unpaired fins (dorsal, anal and caudal fins). During this time, size will have increased to approximately eight or nine millimetres, and the fish will begin to develop colour changes leading to that of the adult fish. From this point, the caudal peduncle patch and dorsal fin patch will begin to appear, but the body will also be seen to be covered in fine black 'pepper dots' between these black patches. Only after a period of 10 to 12 weeks, at which point the fish has assumed a size of 12 to 14 millimetres, will the fish attain the colouration of the adult, and be in all respects a perfect miniature of the parents. Fry of this species are particularly sensitive to changes in water chemistry and to elevated temperatures. While adult fishes can withstand temperatures of 28\u00a0\u00b0C, fry will die of heat stress if exposed to temperatures above 26\u00a0\u00b0C, and their chances of survival are enhanced if the water temperature is kept at 22\u00a0\u00b0C or below. Water changes made to a nursery aquarium during the first 21 days of life of the fry\u2014the critical period during which they manifest the greatest sensitivity to their environment\u2014must be gradual, and the incoming water conditioned to match that of the existing aquarium water where possible before the water change takes place. While the fry are likely to develop best if given infusoria as part of their feeding r\u00e9gime, it is possible to raise fry to adulthood entirely upon prepared foods."

        "description": " Corydoras paleatus is a species of catfish (order Siluriformes) of the family Callichthyidae. Its common names include blue leopard corydoras, mottled corydoras, and peppered catfish.[1] It originates from the lower Paran\u00e1 River basin and coastal rivers in Uruguay and Brazil.[1] This fish species reach about 5.9 - 7 centimeters (2.3 - 2.75 \u00a0in) SL.[1] The male is smaller than the female, and in proportion to body length, the dorsal fin and pectoral fins are longer on the male than the female.[2] Corydoras paleatus is found in the Amazon basin,[1] and feeds on worms, crustaceans, insects, and plant matter.[1] C. paleatus has been known to produce sound; it does this by the abduction of its pectoral fins. This is used by males during courtship and intrapersonal communication, and by both sexes and juveniles when distressed.[2] In reproduction, males do not behave aggressively toward each other, nor do they monopolize mating areas or females.[2] The T-position is involved in courtship, as with many other Corydoras species.[2] Charles Darwin discovered the C. paleatus when he went to Buenos Aires during his expedition aboard the Beagle during the 1830s.[3] It is a very good choice for the community aquarium, as it is a hardy,[4] good-looking, and peaceful fish.[4] They can be successfully kept with other small, peaceful aquarium fish like livebearers, danios, and tetras. It is sometimes seen in the shops as an albino form, although this is similar to other albino corys (see the C. aeneus albino form). It grows to around 7.5\u00a0cm and is easily bred at home. These fish prefer a planted tank with temperatures around 16 to 24 \u00b0C (61 \u2013 75 \u00b0F), although they can take lower temperatures than this as it originates from colder waters.[3] Their high temperature tolerance seems poor, and 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F) is the highest safe temperature. They like to nibble on the algae that grow on floating plants but are not specialized algae-eating catfish. The lighting must not be too bright, and hiding places, such as bogwood, are needed as they like to hide from the light during certain parts of the day. Heavily planted areas should also be provided, where the light is minimized, as they like darker areas due to their bottom-feeding nature. Diet should be sinking pellets, algae wafers, frozen and live food, such as bloodworm or daphnia. They may also occasionally enjoy blanched spinach, which can be attached to plants with a peg or the side of the glass with magnetic clips. They can be seen to dart to the top of the tank: this is because they can use atmospheric oxygen to supplement what their gills extract from the water.[5] They will do this more frequently  when water quality is starting to deteriorate, and so should be watched for this indication. Peppered corydoras reach their sexual maturity and start to show reproductive behaviors once the females reach an average (minimum) size of 5.625 cm (2.214 inches) and once the males reach about 4.875 cm (1.919 inches).[citation needed] The males initiate the courtship ritual, which entails chasing the females around the tank. The female darts away, and the males search for her and find her a few moments later. The males shiver all over the female and may lie down on top of her. When she is ready to spawn, she turns to the male next to her and pounds below his ventral fin. The pair go into the \"T-position\" with the male releasing the sperm into the female's mouth before the sperm fertilizes the eggs[citation needed]. The female cups her ventral fins and lays a few eggs (usually between 4 and 12 eggs[citation needed]) in her fins.  The eggs are about 1.8 mm in diameter[citation needed]. The female now starts cleaning a spot on the glass to put her eggs on. Corydoras are egg depositors and lay their eggs all over the aquarium. Favorite spots include the heater, filters, and the glass, although, occasionally eggs are also laid on plants and driftwood. After depositing a group of eggs closely together, the female rests for a few moments. The males regroup and start chasing each other and then resume chasing the female. The males are so relentless in this pursuit that they try to mate with the female even while she is busy laying her eggs. The spawning lasts more than an hour, and many eggs are laid in different places. On average, about 50 to 150 eggs are laid during a single spawning[citation needed]. The incubation period for the eggs for peppered corydoras was found to be between 96 hours and 113 hours at 24\u00b12\u00b0C, with the average incubation period being about 102 hours (or 4.25 days)[citation needed]. In one study, the average hatching ratio of the eggs was found to be approximately 87%, with the overall egg-laying period lasting between 20 and 35 days[citation needed]. Peppered cories can eat their eggs, but will not eat the living fry.  At first, the fry is small (with a mean length of 7.5246 mm[citation needed]) and is unable to eat, sustaining themselves on the last of their yolk sacs. The fry will begin to eat 1\u20133 days after hatching, and will eat the protozoan organisms in the tank and can be fed powdered food at this stage.  By about one month, the fry will start to become rounder and will begin developing adult coloration, eventually becoming miniature versions of the adults[citation needed]. The juveniles will reach adult size at around 1 year of age, although this varies between individuals and how well they are kept. The age of sexual maturity also varies between individuals, but juveniles will typically begin breeding at around 8\u201312 months of age. However, they can begin as early as 6 months and as late as 18 months of age. From the onset of sexual maturity, it can take the fish up to another year to successfully produce fertile eggs; at first, entire clutches of eggs may be infertile. Albino strains may develop slower and be less fertile due to inbreeding. Media related to Corydoras paleatus at Wikimedia Commons"

        "description": " Corydoras pygmaeus, or the pygmy corydoras or pygmy catfish[1] is a tropical and freshwater fish belonging to the subfamily Corydoradinae of the family Callichthyidae. It originates in tropical inland waters in South America, and is found in the Madeira River basin in Brazil. The first scientific description of the pygmy corydoras was published in 1966 by German biologist and physician Joachim Knaack, in Aquarien und Terrarien-Zeitschrift.[2][3] One specimen was designated the holotype and one additional specimen was collected as a paratype.[2] The scientific name uses the Latin word pygmaeus, meaning dwarf or pygmy.[4] A species of Corydoras with a similar appearance, Corydoras hastatus was described in the 1880s, and many specimens that were described as Corydoras hastatus between the 1920s and 1950s were subsequently found to be misidentified specimens of the pygmy corydoras.[1] In older literature, the pygmy corydoras is frequently mislabeled due to Corydoras hastatus being the only miniature Corydoras species known at the time.[1] The pygmy corydoras is a silver-colored fish, with an unbroken black line that runs horizontally along the center of the sides of the fish from the tip of its snout to its caudal peduncle.[5] It has a second thin black line along the lower part of the side of the body, from behind the ventral fins and continuing into the tail.[5] The top part of the body has a light black or dark gray shading that starts on the top of its snout and ends at the tail.[5] Newly hatched fry have vertical stripes along the sides of their bodies that fade by the end of their first month, when the horizontal stripes of the adult fish begin to appear.[5] The maximum length of the species is about 3.2 centimeters (1.3\u00a0in),[6] but typical adult sizes are 1.9 centimeters (0.75\u00a0in) for males and 2.5 centimeters (1.0\u00a0in) for females.[1] In addition to their larger length, females are also rounder and broader than males, especially when they have eggs.[7] Young fry grow rapidly after hatching, reaching 13 millimeters (0.51\u00a0in) in six to eight weeks.[1] The pygmy corydoras is widely distributed in inland waters in Peru in tributaries of the Nanay River, in Ecuador in tributaries of the Aguarico River, and in western Brazil in tributaries of the Madeira River.[8] The holotype was obtained from Calama, Brazil, along the Madeira River near the mouth of the Ji-Paran\u00e1 River.[6] The pygmy corydoras lives in a tropical climate in water with a 6.0 - 8.0 pH,[9] a water hardness of 2 \u2013 25 dGH,[9] and a temperature range of 22\u201326\u00a0\u00b0C (72\u201379\u00a0\u00b0F).[9] It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. The pygmy corydoras lays approximately 100 eggs at a time.[9] The female holds 2\u20134 eggs at a time in a pouch formed by her pelvic fins while they are fertilized by the male, which takes about 30 seconds.[9] The female swims to a safe location with the fertilized eggs, where she attaches the sticky eggs to a surface, where they will remain.[9] It is a peaceful fish, shoaling fish and can be kept in a community aquarium of smaller fish species such as ember tetras. It can be fed most sinking foods, flakes, frozen food and sinking wafers. It can be kept with small shrimp and snails. In aquariums, they are often kept on fine grained substrate, such as sand. This enables them to dig through the substrate without injury to their barbels, which can often be lost in sharp substrates. They are often kept at a pH of between 6.5 and 7.0. They are schooling fish that are usually kept in groups of at least four and will also behave much more naturally in larger groups (10 or more). Unlike the larger more common Corydoras, they often swim in shoals around the mid water and lower regions of the tank. C. pygmaeus are peaceful fish which will not thrive with aggressive tankmates. They are perhaps best kept in a planted species tank, or with shrimp such as Neocaridina spp. They seem to do best when offered live foods in addition to prepared food items. Appropriate foods include microworms or similar nematodes, as well as Artemia nauplii (newly hatched brine shrimp)."

        "description": " The salt and pepper catfish (Corydoras habrosus) is a tropical freshwater fish belonging to the Corydoradinae sub-family of the family Callichthyidae. It originates in inland waters in South America, and is found in the Upper Orinoco River basin in Venezuela and Colombia. C. habrosus, is often found in periodic wetlands, large floodplains to where other species migrate seasonally. These small corydoras are prone to entrapment in receding waters, and populations can suffer during the dry season.[2] Their natural habitat tends to be abundant in leaf litter and plant life, providing ample cover to allow these fish to roam moderately freely. As a bottom dwelling species C. habrosus tends to stick to the lower regions of the river, however, on occasion corydoras will dart up to the water surface to take in air. They use their intestines as an air breathing organ to absorb oxygen, and expel the remnant air out of the anus.[3] The fish will grow in length up to 1.4 inches (3.5 centimeters). It lives in a tropical climate in water with a 5.5 \u2013 7.5 pH, a water hardness of 2 \u2013 10 dGH, and a temperature of about 77\u00a0\u00b0F (25\u00a0\u00b0C).[4] The diet consists of worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. It is a peaceful fish and can be kept in a community aquarium of smaller fish species such as ember tetras, clown panchax, endler guppies and small species of rasbora.  It should be kept in groups of at least 6 individuals, ideally 10 or more. A shoal should be kept in a tank that is at least 14 gallons in size.[5] Salt and pepper catfish can be fed most small sinking foods including pellets, flake food and preserved baby brine shrimp. Frozen foods such as baby brine shrimp, rotifers and cyclops can also be fed either regularly or exclusively. In captivity, breeding can be difficult to achieve. Some aquarists report that large water changes with relatively cold water can stimulate habrosus in to spawning.[6] Spawning is marked by obvious behaviours; males will swim close to the female, if multiple males are present they will surround the female swimming from side to side quickly. The female holds an egg visibly under her ventral fin ready for fertilising. The female can then be seen to 'massage' the males belly. The female will then choose an appropriate place to deposit her egg, usually on plants near the substrate, particularly on the underside of the leaves but can also be found on the aquarium glass and decor.  Eggs are rarely placed on the top of the leaves or close to the water surface. The spawning male will protect the female from other males attempting to spawn with her.

        "description": " Sterba's corydoras (Corydoras sterbai) is a member of the South American Corydoras genus of freshwater aquarium catfish and one of the most popular species of Corydoras due to its attractive markings. The fish is native to the Guapor\u00e9 River region between Bolivia and Brazil.[1] Sterba's cory is distinguishable from other Corydoras species as it has white spots on a black background on its head. It is occasionally confused with Corydoras haraldschultzi; the difference is that the latter has a pattern of black dots on a white background on the head.  C. sterbai has recently become available in an albino form and a black form. Like many Corydoras species, Sterba's corydoras is a shoaling catfish, and thus should ideally be kept in groups of 5 or more. In the wild it can be found in Brazil and thus, wild caught fish prefer soft, acidic water. However, Sterba's corydoras is a hardy fish and tank bred specimens have adapted to a wider range of water conditions. However, like almost all fish it will not tolerate high levels of nitrates. Unlike some other catfish they are not good algae eaters, but are good at \"cleaning up\" leftover food and detritus from the substrate. Corydoras sterbai are relatively small for catfish, growing to a maximum size of only 2\u20132.6 inches (5.1\u20136.6\u00a0cm). In captivity Corydoras sterbai readily accepts a wide variety of prepared and frozen foods. Flake food is a good staple diet (which will only be consumed once it has fallen to the bottom) as are sinking pellets or wafers. They relish live and frozen foods such as bloodworm, daphnia and mosquito larvae, but ideally should only be fed such foods once a week due to the high amount of protein in them. It is often problematic to feed Corydoras in aquaria with fast feeding mid-water fish such as tetras as flake and sinking pellets are consumed by such fish before they have hit the bottom and sometimes, even while lying on the substrate. However, this problem can be overcome by placing pellets and flake on the aquarium substrate in caves or under bogwood, or other such areas which are not regularly frequented by mid-water fish. The compatibility of C. sterbai is one of their main selling points as with all other Corydoras species as they are very peaceful catfish and can be kept with other peaceful fish. They should not be kept with overly aggressive bottom dwellers, particularly if there is competition over substrate space as there would be in small tanks or tanks with a large amount of \"furniture\". Ideal companions would be similar sized tetras or particularly, dwarf cichlids. Ideally Corydoras sterbai should be housed with a fine substrate such as sand or gravel in order to avoid doing damage to their delicate barbels. However, large gravel will suffice as long as it is not sharp edged. Their only other requirement is that shade be provided for them, by means of overhanging rock, large leaved plants, arching bogwood or caves. Breeding is not too difficult. A tank with dimensions 18\u2033 x 12\u2033 x 12\u2033 (10 US Gallon) is recommended. The breeding ratio that should be kept is 2 males per female. Good diet together with repeated water changes and drops of temperature are usually sufficient. However, raising the fry is not easy due to its high sensitivity. Occasionally problems can arise while transporting these fish as they are capable of secreting a chemical toxin when stressed or overcrowded. For this reason they are never shipped with other fish. The species name of this Corydoras is in honour of Professor Dr. G\u00fcnther Sterba, professor emeritus of zoology of Leipzig University, member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.[2] Professor Sterba is a professional ichthyologist who nevertheless produced several very popular books regarded as virtual bibles for fishkeepers over the 1970s and 1980s, translated into English under the titles Freshwater Fishes of the World, Aquarium Care and (with Dick Mills) The Aquarists' Encyclopedia, despite his degree of isolation at that time by virtue of living in the then German Democratic Republic."

It is often confused with Corydoras trilineatus,[3] the three stripe corydoras. Corydoras julii are small, peaceful shoaling fish, and are typically kept in groups in captivity.[4] Corydoras julii is a relatively small species of fish, growing to be no more than 52 millimeters in length.[5] Its skin is a translucent whitish-gray, with fine black spotting across the body and a horizontal stripe which reaches up the mid-body until it is equal with the front base of the dorsal fin. This spotting pattern is the primary visual difference between C. julii and three stripe corydoras (C. trilineatus), which have larger reticulations, as opposed to spots, and a longer mid-body stripe. C. julii might be further distinguished from C. trilineatus by the spotted pattern on its head; however, C. trilineatus can also show this pattern on occasion.[5] Females are typically larger and rounder than males.[6] Corydoras julii, like almost all Corydoras species, are bottom-feeding scavengers. Their diet consists primarily of small invertebrates which they sift from the substrate, expelling the particles of sand and sediment through their gill openings. In captivity, their diet is frequently sinking pellets rich in insect and other invertebrate proteins, as well as live or frozen invertebrates like bloodworms, daphnia, brine shrimp, and California blackworms (Lumbriculus variegatus).[4] After sexual maturity, Corydoras spawning appears to be triggered by storms.[6] During this storm, the fish eat increased amounts of insects. The water gradually decreases temperature over the course of a few days.[6] Corydoras fish breed in a position resembling a \"T formation\". In this formation, the female swims up to the male's abdomen, and consumes sperm released by the male. The sperm rapidly travels though the female's intestinal tract and fertilizes the eggs in the cloaca. Small, white, sturdy eggs are laid on plant leaves in the wild. Adult corydoras have been known to eat their own eggs.[6]"

It was originally described as Silurus callichthys by Linnaeus in 1758.[1] It is likely to represent a species complex.[2] C. callichthys is distributed in all major river drainages of South America.[2] It is very wide-ranging, extending from Trinidad to  Buenos Aires, Argentina, including the upper Amazon River and Paraguay River systems. The fish will grow in length up to eight inches (20 centimeters).  The females are larger and more robust, and are a dull olive-green, while the males are brighter in color, exhibiting a delicate blue or violet sheen laterally, with a more developed and longer pectoral fin spine that is reddish-brown and edged with orange or reddish-orange. It lives in a variety of water types, from anoxic conditions (slack water zones surrounded by dense vegetation) to slightly turbid, but free-flowing, streams.[1] It can be found in waters with pH range of 5.8 to 8.3, a water hardness of 0\u201330dGH, and a temperature range of 64\u201383\u00a0\u00b0F (18\u201328\u00a0\u00b0C).[1] When its biotype becomes dry, it can move out of the water, due to its ability to swallow air and use its intestines to absorb oxygen from the atmosphere, to find more water.[1] It feeds at night on fish, insects, and plant matter.  Juveniles feed on rotifers, in addition to the microcrustaceans and aquatic insect larvae they find when digging into the substrate.[1] During reproduction, the male's belly turns orange and its pectoral spines become longer and thicker.  The male builds a bubble nest with some floating plants, fiercely guarding it after the female lays down her eggs.[1] The cascarudo is of commercial importance in the aquarium trade industry and of minor importance as a food source.[1] It can be kept in aquariums, with groups of more than five individuals recommended.[1]"

        "description": " Megalechis thoracata (black marble hoplo, spotted hoplo[1]) is a species of catfish of the family Callichthyidae.  M. thoracata is found east of the Andes in the Amazon, Orinoco, and upper Paraguay River basins, as well as in the coastal rivers of the Guianas and northern Brazil. Recent introductions were recorded in the upper Paran\u00e1 River drainage.[2] Overview: The Spotted Hoplo Catfish is an incredibly hardy and relatively easy species to keep in captivity, with the main difficulty being the maximum size of around 6 inches, or 15\u00a0cm.They are a very peaceful fish, with the only exception being when the males are guarding a bubble nest at breeding time. They can be kept with almost all tankmates, but they will likely eat anything that can fit in their mouths due to their opportunistic nature. This rule also applies for larger fish, as the Hoplo may get eaten or have its barbels or fins damaged by large, potentially aggressive fish, such as South American Cichlids, African Cichlids, larger catfish and most larger fish species that can fit the Hoplo in its mouth or shows aggression. Tank Setup: They require a soft sand substrate, as they are bottom dwellers that can often be observed foraging/searching for food. A gentle substrate is essential, as other coarse grained or abrasive substrates can irritate the fish's sensitive barbels, and even cause them to fall off. To thrive in the aquarium, they need a minimum tank size of 55 US liquid gallons, but as a rule of thumb for this fish, the larger the tank, the better.[3][4] They are semi-social creatures that prefer to be kept in groups of at least five, but still seem content alone or in pairs. The spotted hoplo catfish needs hiding places, usually in the form of rocks, wood and plants, such as variations of Anubias, valisineria, java fern and micranthemum. Floating plants are also appreciated, as they provide extra cover. Water Conditions: Despite the Hoplo being a very hardy fish, like all fish they need a mature, cycled tank with the correct parameters for almost all tropical species. As they are a species of tropical fish, the optimal temperature for them is around 24\u201328 degrees Celsius, but they can adapt to temperatures in the 22\u201330 degrees Celsius range, although this is not recommended and over a long period of time this can lead to elevated stress levels, amongst other health concerns. The natural habitat of Megalechis thoracata is slow flowing, low oxygen parts of the  Amazon, Orinoco, and upper Paraguay River basins. For this reason, catfish of the family Callichthyidae among other fish, have developed a unique way of breathing, where the fish will rise to the surface of the water and ingest a small amount of air.[5] The oxygen is then absorbed through the lining of the stomach and intestine. This is known as gastrointestinal respiration. They will feed on small to medium-sized worms and other invertebrates, small fish, and general detritus. M. thoracata has been observed to produce sounds during territorial behavior in males at their nest sites and especially during spawning, and during aggressive behavior in both sexes. M. thoracata males aggressively defend territories against intruders.[6]"

        "description": " Ancistrus is a genus of nocturnal freshwater fish in the family Loricariidae of order Siluriformes, native to freshwater habitats in South America and Panama. Fish of this genus are common in the aquarium trade where they are known as bushynose or bristlenose catfish. In the aquarium hobby they are often referred to as bushynose or bristlenose plecos instead, but this may lead to confusion as \"pleco\" usually is used for Hypostomus plecostomus and its allies and is often used as a catchall term for any loricariids remotely resembling that species. The type species is Ancistrus cirrhosus.[1] This genus is the largest genus within the tribe Ancistrini.[2] The name ancistrus derives from the Ancient Greek agkistron \"hook\"\u00a0\u2013 a reference to the form of the cheek odontodes. The genera Pristiancistrus, Thysanocara and Xenocara are now synonyms of Ancistrus.[2] Ancistrus species show all the typical features of the Loricariidae. This includes a body covered in bony plates and a ventral suckermouth.[3] The feature most commonly associated with the genus are the fleshy tentacles found on the head in adult males; females may possess tentacles along the snout margin but they are smaller and they lack tentacles on the head.[3] Tentacules, tentacles directly associated with odontodes, develop on the pectoral fin spine of the males of some species.[3] Males also have evertible cheek odontodes which are less developed or absent in females. They also lack odontodes along the snout.[2] In comparison with a typical loricariid (pleco), a bristlenose is typically shorter (4\u20136 inches or 15\u00a0cm or less), more flattened and fatter with a comparatively wider head. Colouration is typically mottled brown, grey or black. Small white or yellow spots are common.[2] In contrast to many other loricariid 'plecos' (many of which regularly exceed a foot in captivity), the bristlenose plecos do not usually exceed six inches in length; they can thus be kept in relatively small tanks, contributing to their popularity in the aquarium hobby. Ancistrus species are unusual among vertebrates in possessing an X0 sex-determination system, which is the prevailing method in many lineages of arthropod but is very rare elsewhere in the animal kingdom.[4] Ancistrus is one of the widest ranging Loricariid genera, and representatives are found in most areas where the family in general is present.[2] Many species are found in the rivers and floodplain areas of the Amazon basin, but there are also species elsewhere in tropical South America, as well as species on the island of Trinidad and two species, A. centrolepis and A. chagresi in Panama.[5] Three species are true cavefish (troglobites): A. cryptophthalmus, A. galani and A. formoso.[6][7] These are the only known loricariids that possess adaptions for a subterranean lifestyle, such as reduced pigmentation (appearing overall whitish) and eyes.[6] In the wild, Ancistrus species prefer flowing water, so tanks with flow are typically used when keeping them in captivity. Since they are bottom-dwelling fish, substrate is considered preferable to a bare tank floor. Mixtures of gravel, dirt, and clay are frequently used as substrate for Ancistrus. The aquarium size that is considered by some to be a minimum for fish of this genus is 25 gallons.[8] There are currently 76 recognized species in this genus:[9] The diet of this genus is typical for a Loricariid\u00a0\u2013 algae, aufwuchs, and detritus, with sediment, sand, and gravel presumably ingested accidentally alongside food items.[13][14][15][16][17][18] Despite reports among fish-keepers that they require wood in their diet, no scientific evidence to date supports members of this genus feeding on wood.  Bristlenoses do not school but hide when not feeding, juveniles however are typically found in brightly lit shallows at the water margin making them susceptible to predation by birds. Ancistrus species have the capability of obtaining oxygen through their modified stomach.[19] This allows them to survive in conditions with low oxygen levels.[2] Breeding takes place in hollows, caves and mud holes in banks. Males may clean the inside of the cavity with their suckermouth before allowing the female to approach and inspect the nest.  Courtship includes expanding the dorsal and caudal fins and attempts by the male to escort the female to the nest. While the female inspects the nest, the male keeps close contact.[3] The female may lay 20\u2013200 adhesive eggs, usually to the ceiling of the cavity.[3] The female plays no role in parental care; the male takes care of its young. Males will clean the eggs and the cavity with its fins and mouth. Males inspect eggs to remove diseased or infertile eggs, and aerates the clutch by fanning them with its pectoral and pelvic fins.[3] During this time, a male usually will not leave the cavity to feed, or will leave only occasionally and quickly return.[3] The eggs hatch in 4\u201310 days over a period of 2\u20136 hours; the male guards the eggs for 7\u201310 days after hatching.[3] The fry remain in the cave, attaching to the walls and ceiling with their mouths, absorbing their yolk sac in 2\u20134 days and becoming free swimming.[3] Males of these species are competitive and territorial. Males display to each other by positioning themselves parallel to each other, head to tail, with dorsal and caudal fins erect and cheek odontode spines everted. If this escalates to combat, the males will circle each other and direct attacks at the head.[3] If an intruding male manages to evict another male from the nest, it may cannibalize the other male's young.[3] A male bristlenose may guard several clutches of eggs simultaneously. Females prefer males that are already protecting eggs and may prefer males that are protecting larvae; it has been suggested that the tentacles may act as a fry mimic to attract females, which would allow males without eggs in their nest to compete with males guarding eggs.[3] Several clutches in various states of development from eggs to free-swimming larvae can be found in one nest.[2] These fish are often kept by aquarists, as they are dutiful algae-eaters and smaller in adult size than the common plecos usually seen in pet shops. They reach up to 15\u00a0cm in males, and 12\u00a0cm in females. Their recommended temperature is 23\u201327 degrees Celsius. Their lifespan is up to 12 years. They are hardy animals, tolerant to a wide range of water conditions. They breed easily in captivity, and are compatible with most other freshwater fish. Though typically mottled brown or black-and-grey spotted in color, other species are more exotic\u00a0\u2013 spots of bright yellow on a dark background being a common pattern. Albino variants are also common. The albino morph is not caused by exposure to light during development, it is a morph controlled by genetics.[20] Historically, commonly available species of Ancistrus were Ancistrus cirrhosus and Ancistrus temminckii; other species are now available, though exact identification is difficult. Feeding is easy, bristlenoses will graze on algae/ algae wafers and other surface growing organisms as well as eating algae wafers or tablets, flake food, squash, spinach, cucumber, zucchini, green beans peas and even sliced carrots. They have also been known to accept frozen bloodworms as part of their diet. Aquarium specimens may starve for lack of algae or other plant matter; algae wafers or other low-protein foods are recommended. Keepers should watch for the abdomen to take on a sunken appearance, indicating insufficient nutrition. Sexing is very easy as the female will only occasionally have bristles, around the edge of the chin, whereas the male will have them up the center of the head. Breeding is also possible. Males attract females to a small cave or hollow, then guard eggs after fertilization through hatching (4\u20138 days) until fry are free swimming (4\u20136 days after hatching); the aquarist need only supply a suitable cave, food, and one of each sex. Caution should be taken with the spines (odontodes)\u00a0; although the risk of personal injury is small with this genus, the hooked nature of the odontodes means that a bristlenose may become trapped in non-natural material such as sponge filters and netting."

They inhabit flowing sections of rivers, especially clearwater, in the basins of the Amazon (notably Trombetas, Tapaj\u00f3s, Xingu and Tocantins) and Orinoco (notably Ventuari) in Brazil and Venezuela. The largest species reach up to 34\u00a0cm (13\u00a0in) in total length.[2] Most Baryancistrus are differentiated from other related genera by a membrane connecting their dorsal fin and adipose fin, not present in most other genera.[3] The species of this genus are mainly herbivores and detritivores, but may take other foods in an aquarium setting. Most have probably not been bred in captivity. It is difficult to sex these fish, including adult specimens. These fish are mainly nocturnal, but will also emerge from their hiding places during the day, after some time getting accustomed to the aquarium. Adequate hiding places are recommended for these fish due to their primary nocturnal nature. There are currently eight recognized species in this genus:[2][4] Though there are many types of fish described as Baryancistrus, there are many that yet to be given a true scientific designation, and are only referred to under the L-number system, including the Gold Nuggets. Here is a list of Baryancistrus by L-number designation. The common name and scientific name are included when available, though some of these fish are only commonly referred to by their L-number. For those fish without a scientific name, they are assumed to be Baryancistrus sp. * Note: L200 is also used to refer to Hemiancistrus subviridis, another Loricariid that is very similar in appearance to B. demantoides.

        "description": " Rineloricaria (from the Greek, rhinos meaning nose, and the Latin, lorica meaning cuirass of leather) is a genus of freshwater tropical catfish (order Siluriformes) belonging to the family Loricariidae. They are commonly called whiptail catfish because of the long filament that grows out of the tip of the caudal fin that is characteristic of the genus. With the exception of R. altipinnis from Panama, they are native to the rivers of northern and central South America. Some species are regularly seen in the aquarium trade. This genus was described by Pieter Bleeker in 1862, with R. lima as the type species.[1] This genus is by far one of the most speciose of the subfamily Loricariinae, containing about 30 species.[2] On the other hand, it is one of the least resolved genera.[3] In 2008, 14 new species were added to this genus.[2][4][5][6][7] Hemiloricaria, Fonchiiichthys, and Leliella been variably considered synonyms of Rineloricaria; these genera were erected to account for differences in sexually dimorphic traits. However, the traits used to diagnose these genera have been thought to be insufficient.[2] There are currently 67 recognized species in this genus:[8] The genus is widely distributed on nearly the entire subcontinent, from Costa Rica to Argentina, on both slopes of the Andes.[11] Rineloricaria species are found in a large variety of habitats, including large rivers, streams, and lagoons, associated with bottoms consisting of sand or rocks, sometimes found in marginal vegetation. They are also found to tolerate environments with a wide temperature gradient.[6] Rineloricaria have an adaptive capacity enabling many species to exploit the most varied habitats; some species, such as R. strigilata, have been caught in highly polluted bodies of water and represent some of the main components of the ichthyological diversity in such habitats.[3] The average length of a Rineloricaria catfish is about 13\u00a0cm (5\u00a0in) long.[citation needed] The fish are long, slender, have no visible barbels, an erect dorsal fin, a very thin caudal peduncle, and a narrow face. The coloration of the fishes is usually light brown with darker blotches, and have a dark dorsal fin.[citation needed] They are also covered with bony plates and have a sucker disk mouth, as is common with most fish in the family Loricariidae. Sexual dimorphism includes hypertrophied development of the odontodes along the sides of the head, on the pectoral spines and rays, and predorsal area of mature males. Several species also show hypertrophied development of the odontodes on the entire caudal peduncle.[11] In males, the pectoral fin spine is often thick, short, and curved when compared to the female.[2] Rineloricaria are cavity brooders. Numerous eggs (often more than 100) are laid attached to one another in single layer masses on the cavity floor, and are brooded by males.[11] Rineloricaria exhibit high levels of karyotypic diversity with chromosome numbers ranging from 36 to 70.[11]"

        "description": " The genus Panaque contains a small number of small to medium-sized South American suckermouth armoured catfishes that are notable for being among the very few vertebrates that feed extensively on wood.[1]  In addition, algae and aufwuchs are an important part of the diet, and they use their rasping teeth to scrape this from rocks. These fish are also popular aquarium fish, where the sound of scraping as these fish forage for food is easily audible.[citation needed] Scobinancistrus and Panaqolus are sometimes considered to be subgenera of this genus.[2] There are currently seven recognized species in this genus:[3] The name Panaque is a Latinisation of a native Venezuelan name for these fish. It is pronounced \"pan ack\" in Britain and Europe, but often as \"pan aki\" or \"pan a kay\" in America. The Japanese call these fish \"pana koo ee\".[citation needed] Panaque are found in the Magdalena River, Orinoco River, Amazon River, Essequibo River, and Lake Maracaibo drainages.[5] All Panaque come from tropical South American and inhabit fast-flowing streams and rivers. They are weak swimmers but like other armoured catfish possess a strong sucker-like mouth with which they can hold on to submerged rocks and wood.[citation needed] Like other members of the armoured catfish family (Loricariidae), all Panaque have sturdy, armoured bodies covered in toughened plates of skin called scutes. These are not scales; like all catfish, Panaque lack scales. As well their armour, these catfish have very sturdy dorsal and pectoral fin spines. They use these defensively, either to wedge themselves into cracks from which predators cannot pull them, or else to prevent large predators from swallowing them. Another characteristic typical of the armoured catfish family is an iris. Most fish are unable to regulate the amount of light that enters the eye since they have irises that cannot change size. Both male and female Panaque develop bristles, known as odontodes, on the side of head immediately before and onto the pectoral fins.[citation needed] Unlike predatory catfish, these omnivorous catfish have very short barbels. These barbels can be seen in the photograph of mouth of a Panaque shown here; they are the short pointed structures on either side of a suckermouth. This sucker-like mouth allows them to attach to rocks and remain stationary with very little expenditure of energy.[citation needed] Along with the species of the Hypostomus cochliodon group (formerly the genus Cochliodon), it has been argued that Panaque are the only fish that can eat and digest wood.[5] Possible adaptations to consuming wood include spoon-shaped, scraper-like teeth and highly angled jaws to chisel wood.[5] Researchers have also identified symbiotic gut bacteria that may allow the fish to digest the wood they consume.[6] However, others have argued that Panaque do not in fact digest wood, and in fact take up very little energy from the wood they consume and actually lose weight when fed just wood.[7] Furthermore, their digestive tracts are no different from those of related catfish and they do not hold wood particles in the gut longer than other catfish, suggesting Panaque are not physically adapted to eating wood, and are in fact detritivores much like other Loricariidae.[7] In September 2010 scientists from the US National Science Foundation claimed to have discovered a new species of wood-eating catfish in the Alto Pur\u00fas National Park, Peru.[8] Several species of Panaque have become popular aquarium fish. The brightly coloured Panaque nigrolineatus is particularly popular and is known as the \"royal panaque\" or \"royal pleco\", monikers which reflect its comparative costliness and beauty over the common pleco. Royal plecos have a greyish-green base color against which thick, dark bluish-black stripes are set; their fins are edged with gold or cream, and their eyes are red. In captivity, royal plecos typically grow to around 30\u00a0centimeters in length.[9] A second species, Panaque cochliodon, is familiar to many aquarists as the \"blue-eyed pleco\". Though the blue-eyed pleco was widely traded in the late 1980s and early 1990s, it is now only rarely exported from its native Colombia.[10] It is also associated with the binomina Panaque suttonorum and P. suttoni, though Panaque suttonorum is a different fish which only comes from Venezuela. Blue-eyed plecos reach a similar size to royal plecos, but because many specimens are infected with a bacterium closely related to Rickettsia, mortality immediately after import can be high.[11] However, once they have settled in and begun feeding, they are no more difficult to keep than royal plecos.[citation needed] All Panaque catfish require much the same care in captivity. Panaque mainly demand a mixed diet including green algae, fresh vegetables such as carrots, courgettes, and spinach, but because they are argued to be xylophagous, many aquarists provide driftwood for them to graze upon, as well. The meaty foods enjoyed by other plecos are not required. Because they are relatively big for aquarium fish and produce an unusually large amount of waste, a high-capacity tank and filter are essential. Royal panaques tolerate a wider range of water chemistry than others\u2014they prefer somewhat soft, slightly acid water but they will tolerate hard, alkaline water.[citation needed] In terms of behavior, Panaque are peaceful and nocturnal bottom-dwellers which make good residents in community tanks. Like most of the other armored catfish, they are territorial, and groups should only be kept in very large tanks.[citation needed]"

        "description": " Pseudorinelepis genibarbis is a species of armored catfish native to Brazil, Peru, and Ecuador where it is found in the Amazon basin.[1] Pseudorinelepis is one of three genera contained in the tribe Rhinelepini, one of the tribes of Hypostominae.[2] Canthopomus and Monistiancistrus are synonyms of the genus Pseudorinelepis.[3] Previously, Pseudorinelepis was a genus of four species, but now the other three species are synonymous with P. genibarbis.[3] P. genibarbis is large and bulky and reaches a length of 35.6 centimetres (14.0\u00a0in) SL.[1] The armor plates along the side of the fish are thick, are keeled, and encase the whole body.[3] The adipose fin is not present.[3] Like other members of Rhinelepini, they do not have the omega iris that is typical in most species of Loricariids.[3] In Iquitos, Peru, it is known as carachama sin costilla, which actually means \"Loricariid without ribs\"; this refers to the trait that it shares with other Rhinelepini catfish that do not have ribs past the sixth vertebra.[3] This species is highly variable in coloration. P. genibarbis may be completely dark brown to black, mottled with tan to dark brown background and black streaks, or light tan with large, sparse spots located at base of lateral plates, fin membranes, and abdomen.[3] Males have longer odontodes on the cheek that are denser and more numerous than in females. It has been suggested that breeding males may also have orange on the cheeks and dorsal and caudal fin spines, although this may be restricted to fish from the Branco River.[3] P. genibarbis is found in small, sluggish streams, floodplain lakes, and large rivers.[3] Water quality measurements showed that the water tended to be low in oxygen, but neutral (pH\u00a07.0).[1] P. genibarbis is able to swallow air, like many other Loricariids. However, this species is not an obligate air-breather.[1] When disturbed, it is able to swallow air to become neutrally buoyant and swim in the water column.[1] This species is an armored catfish which, since the 1990s, has started to be offered quite regularly as an aquarium fish under the name \"Pineapple Pleco\".[citation needed] The term \"pleco\" here is of course a popular generalisation, as taxonomy has never placed this fish in the former genus Plecostomus. The armour is also pleasantly spiked along the sides of the fish, which causes the pineapple resemblance celebrated in the commercial name of the species. Additionally, under the L-number system used by hobbyists, it as referred to as both L152 and L095. There is quite a degree of colour variation, which is probably the main reason for the confusion over species. Some males having orange cheeks, which is why \"orange cheek Pleco\" is another common name found in circulation.[4] This is not made any easier by the fact that the fish will gradually darken if left in a tank with a darker substrate and lighten when kept on a lighter substrate. These changes take some time (hours or days) to effect, they do not happen quickly, so there is no real \"chameleon\" effect here, but no doubt it is a useful survival mechanism.[citation needed] From the viewpoint of the aquarist the fish is peaceful, sociable with others of its own type, non-territorial and omnivorous. Unsurprisingly, therefore, they do well in soft water, although pH values of up to 7.5 are acceptable, and the temperature range may fluctuate gently between 23-27\u00a0\u00b0C (73.4-80.6\u00a0\u00b0F.[4] Spawning in captivity has not yet been reliably reported.[4] Sexual dimorphism is slight, being determined mainly by a more rounded body shape in the females, and orange \"cheeks\", this refers to the operculum, in the males. The fish will, unlike most hypostomines, feed on flake from the water surface, turning upside-down to do so.[citation needed] It is also able to augment water-dissolved oxygen with atmospheric oxygen, but does not need to do so, having fully functional gills, so when this fish does gulp it is a useful warning that the aeration in the tank is low.[1]"

This species will grow to a maximum length of 43 centimetres (17\u00a0in) SL and reach a weight of 310 g.[1] It is sometimes confused with the Hypostomus plecostomus (another armored catfish known as the \"common plecostomus\").[2] The two species can be distinguished by their number of dorsal rays. P. pardalis has 11\u201313, while the H. plecostomus has only 5\u20138 dorsal rays. It is also commonly misindentified as P. disjunctivus and can be differentiated by its spotted patterning.[3] There is an albino color variation of this species, usually referred to as an \"Albino Plecostomus\".[4] The amelanistic form may also be sold as the \"chocolate pleco\".[5] The species is native to the Amazon River Basin of Brazil and Peru, preferring pH ranges of 7.0\u20137.5. It is a facultative air breather; although normally a bottom-dwelling fish, it has the ability to breathe air from the surface of the water during dry periods or when dissolved oxygen is too low. The Amazon sailfin catfish has been introduced to a number of countries outside its native range.[1] It is recorded in the Marikina River in the Philippines and known as the \"janitor fish\", where it has become a local pest and sold in bulk, in efforts to eliminate the fish.[6][7][8][9] In the United States, invasive populations of sailfin catfishes like the Amazon sailfin catfish have been observed to be ecologically detrimental, as they disrupt aquatic food chains, decrease the abundance of native aquatic species, and degrade aquatic plants or banks of waterbodies through burrowing and tunneling.[10]"

Hypostomus punctatus is a freshwater fish native to South America, in the coastal drainages of southeastern Brazil and Uruguay. It is one of a number of species commonly referred to as \"plecostomus\" or \"common pleco\" by aquarists. H. punctatus is a species of loricariid catfish. Like other members of this family, it possesses a suckermouth, armor plates, strong dorsal and pectoral fin spines, and the omega iris. This species reaches about 30 centimetres (12\u00a0in) TL.[1] Hypostomus punctatus is difficult to distinguish from closely related species, such as Hypostomus plecostomus. Identification is relatively difficult as there are many different similar species labelled as \"common pleco\". This species has a light brown coloration with a pattern of darker brown spots (its specific epithet, punctatus, means \"spotted\"). Because of this, the species may also be known as the spotted hypostomus. The species is not notably striped and is generally lighter in coloration than H. plecostomus.[2] H. punctatus is found in the wild in fast-flowing rivers as well as in flooded areas. It prefers water with a temperature of 22\u201328\u00a0\u00b0C, a pH range of 5\u20138, and a dH range of 0.5\u201325.[1] H. punctatus is primarily herbivorous and feeds on algae and detritus as well as plants and roots.[1]"

Although the name Hypostomus plecostomus is often used to refer to common plecostomus sold in aquarium shops, most are actually members of other genera.[3][1] Suckermouth catfish are of little or no value as a food fish, although they are at least occasionally consumed over their native range.[citation needed] A demand exists for them, however, as a bottom cleaner in the aquarium trade.[4] This species' native range is tropical northeastern South America; it naturally occurs in northeastern Brazil, the Guianas, and Trinidad and Tobago.[5] Confusingly, the name Hypostomus plecostomus (or Plecostomus plecostomus) has sometimes been incorrectly used for several more-or-less similar loricariid catfishes, both in the popular and scientific literature. For example, it has sometimes been suggested that it occurs in southern Central America, but this is an entirely separate species, Hemiancistrus aspidolepis (also known under another synonym, Hypostomus panamensis).[6][7] Some Loricariidae species have been widely introduced to several countries around the world and reported as H. plecostomus.[5] It is erroneous,[1] and the concerned species belong to the genus Pterygoplichthys (either P. pardalis,[8] P. disjunctivus,[9] P. anisitsi[10] or P. multiradiatus[11]). In the United States, a Pterygoplichthys species has been introduced to some regions in the South, most likely released by aquarists into the local waters. For example, they are present in a lake in the neighborhood of Hammock Trace Preserve in Melbourne, Florida. In Texas, reproducing populations occur in spring-influenced habitats of the San Antonio River (Bexar County), Comal Springs (Comal County), San Marcos River (Hays County), and San Felipe Creek (Val Verde County), as well as in drainage canals in the Rio Grande Valley and Houston.[12][13] The same identification issues have spread in the literature regarding the invasive catfishes in Taiwan, with H. plecostomus being one of the numerous names used to designate the species: DNA studies showed the alien fishes were actually P. pardalis and P. disjunctivus (that hybridise extensively).[14] H. plecostomus prefer to live in water between 72 and 86 degrees Fahrenheit (~22.2 to 30 degrees Celsius), with a pH between 6.5 and 7.5.[15] Hypostomus plecostomus is named for its sucker-like mouth, which allows it to adhere to a surface, as well as to hold and rasp at food, including newly hatched and baby golden apple snails as well as Malaysian trumpet snails.[16] This omnivorous species also feeds on algae, aquatic plants, and small crustaceans.[17][citation needed] Hypostomus plecostomus is one of many species of fish that is able to breathe air. Hypostomus plecostomus relies on its gills for respiration in normal and slightly hypoxic water, and the less oxygen present in the water, the more frequently it surfaces to breathe air.[18] The air is taken to the stomach where the oxygen is absorbed, and the air can be kept in the stomach to increase buoyancy, which may help it to feed on vegetation.[19] H. plecostomus is one of a number of species commonly referred to as \"plecostomus\" or \"common pleco\" by aquarists.  These fish are sold when they are young and small, but in the wild, they can grow to be a maximum size of 50 centimetres (20\u00a0in).[20] In captivity, however, a full-grown Hypostomus plecostomus only reaches 15 inches (38\u00a0cm) on average, which could be explained by the subpar oxygen levels in most home aquaria and other practices of bad fish husbandry.[21] In the aquarium trade, this dark-colored, bottom-feeding, nocturnal catfish is often purchased for its ability to clean algae from fish tanks but also contributes a lot of waste to the nitrogen cycle. They are difficult for other fish to harass, both due to the semi-aggressive nature of the fish as well as its thick armor.[22] In Bangladesh, the species, among some other suckermouth catfishes has become invasive. The government is currently on its way to impose a ban on the farming, hatchling production, breeding, marketing and trading of the fish.[23] It has also raised serious concern in India and Sri Lanka.[24] A large variety of common names is used to describe H. plecostomus, where plecostomus and the shortened \"pleco\" are interchangeable in all common names. The names include: The species' scientific name, Hypostomus plecostomus, is derived from the Latin hypo (meaning \"under\"), stoma (meaning \"mouth\"), and pleco (meaning \"pleated\").[citation needed] Many of the common names used to identify Hypostomus plecostomus are also used for other species, which augments the confusion surrounding H. plecostomus and other Loricariidae such as H. punctatus, Pterygoplichthys multiradiatus and P. pardalis. In 2012, Weber, Covain, and Fisch-Muller showed the type series of Carl Linnaeus was heterogenous and comprised two species: H. plecostomus (for which the authors designate a lectotype) and H. watwata.[1]"

        "description": " Pterygoplichthys gibbiceps[1]  is a species of armored catfish native to Brazil, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela where it is found in the Orinoco and Amazon basins. Pterygoplichthys gibbiceps shows all the characteristic features of its genus\u2014a large dorsal fin with more than nine rays, prominent nasal flares and a prominent hump or crest anterior to the dorsal fin as well as a substantial base to the dorsal fin. Adult fish easily attain a length of 50.0 centimetres (19.7\u00a0in) TL and can live for more than 20 years. A typical plec shape is shown, patternation consists of primarily irregular largish brown spots on a yellowish backgroung giving a honeycombed like appearance, additional pattern features common to related species may be visible on close inspection. As this fish grows the spots get smaller. Like most plecs this species is primarily herbivorous though will eat dead animals. In the wild these fish are found in shoals in sluggish rivers of the Amazon and Orinoco river systems, they also occupy flooded land during the wet season. During the dry season P. gibbiceps will aestivate in burrows around 1 metre long dug into mud banks along the length of a river, egg rearing is also presumed to take place in burrow. The species name comes from the Latin gibbus\u2014hump, and caput\u2014head, a reference to the centrally located ridge. Common names include 'gibbys', leopard sailfin catfish and clown plecs\u2014the juveniles have a comical appearance due to the large and obvious spots. Ancistrus gibbiceps and Glyptoperichthys gibbiceps are synonyms of P. gibbiceps.\nThe fish has recently been caught from river Ganges, Banaras and is suspected to be yet another entrant to Invasive exotic list of fish in India. This fish is extremely popular in the aquarium, due to its unusual appearance and its ability to eat algae; the bane of all aquarists. This and other related species are bred in ponds in tropical regions for the aquarium trade. In general P. gibbiceps is peaceful towards other fish though territorial disputes arise with other plecos and fish of a similar or larger size. Though not nocturnal they are more active at night and will spend daylight hours 'hiding' in a secluded location. As the fish grows big (up to 60.96\u00a0cm in the aquarium) a large tank with good filtration is required, in general these fish are tolerant to a wide range of freshwater conditions though prefer well aerated water. The fish will 'gulp' surface air in poorly oxygenated water. A lesser-known trait is its mild camouflage ability, where it can lighten or darken its scales in a tiger-stripe pattern. It may reflect its mood or comfortability with the water parameters.[2][3] Pterygoplichthys gibbiceps is an omnivore. They can be fed with vegetables such as nettles, lettuce, spinach or carrots. Their diet can include meat; such as earthworms, blood worms or chopped shrimps.  They will also eat prepared foods from a pet shop, especially sinking algae wafers. The best way to breed Pterygoplichthys gibbiceps is to feed them with wide spectrum of food. With a good diet, they will grow quickly (up to 30 centimetres in one year). Adult Pterygoplichthys gibbiceps  may eat many aquarium plants. It can be almost impossible to differentiate males from females. Males in a group can be determined as they may become more territorial. Reproduction involves females laying roes into caves or hollows of roots. There is a high rate of mortality until the spawn are five centimeters long. The reason for this is unknown."

        "description": " The zebra pleco (Hypancistrus zebra) is a species of catfish endemic to a small section of the Rio Xingu in Brazil. It occurs in the big bend area of the river, downstream from the town of Altamira, Para. It was first described in 1991.[3] It gets its name from its black and white stripes, resembling the colouration of a zebra. This species grows to a length of 6.4 centimetres (2.5\u00a0in) SL.[3] This species was exported from Brazil in 1987 for sale as aquarium fish. However, currently, the Brazilian government bans the export of certain fish species, including H. zebra. H. zebra is threatened by the Belo Monte Dam in the Xingu river which has caused a severe reduction of the water flow of the entire known distribution range of the species. Due to this, the species has been classified as critically endangered and may soon become extinct in the wild. It is subject to several captive breeding programs. It is commercially bred in captivity for the aquarium trade. Mature males have a wider head and longer interopercular spines than females. After spawning, the males will guard the eggs. The fry swim after seven days and absorb the yolk sac in two weeks.[4] The minimum tank size for the species is said to be a minimum of 30 gallons (approximately 115 liters).\u00a0Maintaining water parameters at certain levels is also of importance when keeping them in an aquarium. The ideal water temperature for their tank is about 79\u201388\u00a0\u00b0F (26\u201331\u00a0\u00b0C). Reasonable water acidity levels are 6.5 pH to 7.0 pH with the water hardness ranging between 2 and 6 dKH.[5] Hypancistrus zebra can be referred to using the L-numbering convention often applied to Loricariidae, although, unlike most loricariids, H. zebra has two associated L-numbers: L-046 and L-098 both refer to the species. H. zebra is a predator and requires a high protein diet, typically including small invertebrates such as insect larvae. When in captivity, the species is often fed fresh or frozen bloodworms, brine shrimp and algae wafers. Occasionally, the species may be fed vegetables such as lettuce, cucumber, and squash.[5] This species should not be kept in the typical community aquarium, or with discus, despite advice to the contrary. These catfish thrive in biotopes with small dither fish which do not compete with H. zebra for food. The tank should mimic their natural environment with a substrate of small smooth gravel and pebbles with smooth boulders, cobbles and rocks forming caves and crevices.[6] The water must be highly oxygenated with a strong flow and surface agitation. It is an expensive species because it can only be collected or reproduced in small numbers. It is a simple fish to keep but it needs clean, warm water and a fast-moving current. They are unlikely to survive in still water or a dirty environment.[4] It is nocturnal, moderately territorial, and prefers plenty of hiding places.[4] In 2004, the zebra pleco was added to the IBAMA list of endangered species and exporting it from Brazil was made illegal. However, this law is only present in Brazil and black market fish traders smuggle them out of Brazil to then sell in other countries (primarily Colombia). Similarly to other Hypancistrus species, the male will trap the female in a cave where she will lay her eggs for the male to fertilise. This is usually done at around a pH of 6.5-7.2 and a water temp of 27\u00b0. This process can take between 1 and 5 days depending on the experience the female has in motherhood. The male will often bite the female to keep her in the cave, which is a natural behaviour for the species. Once the eggs are fertilised, the female will leave, although the male will guard the eggs until they hatch and may even stay to see them develop into fry. Once born, the fry will have a yolk sack attached to their underbelly, which is typically gone in a few days.[7] The species is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that international trade (including in captive bred specimens) is regulated by the CITES permitting system.[2]"

It belongs to the armored catfish family (Loricariidae). Named for its sail-like dorsal fin, the part of its scientific name multiradiatus means \"many-rayed\" and refers to the rays of the dorsal fin. P. multiradiatus is one of a number of species commonly referred to as the common pleco by aquarists.[1] Other scientific names that were used (as synonyms) for P. multiradiatus include Hypostomus multiradiatus, Ancistrus multiradiatus, and Liposarcus multiradiatus. P. multiradiatus is sometimes confused with Pterygoplichthys pardalis, which is a different species of pleco. P. multiradiatus goes by a number of common names. It can be called the \"long-fin armored catfish\" in Hawaii, \"sailfin catfish\", \"sailfish catfish\", \"many-rayed (multiradiatus) pleco\" or \"radiated ptero\" in the United States, \u591a\u8f3b\u7ffc\u7532\u9bf0 in Mandarin Chinese.\nP. multiradiatus is mottled brown/black and inhabits freshwater streams and lakes and in weedy, mud-bottomed canals in its native habitat: the Orinoco River basin in Venezuela. Its geographic distribution is 10\u00b0N - 1\u00b0N, 68\u00b0W - 61\u00b0W. This tropical, nocturnal bottom-dweller likes warm water at the temperature range of 23\u201327\u00a0\u00b0C, pH range: 6.5\u20137.8, and dH range: 4\u201320. P. multiradiatus browses on substrate, mainly feeding on benthic algae and aquatic weeds, but will also take worms, insect larvae and other bottom-dwelling invertebrates as food. One of the large plecos (growing to a maximum of 50.0 centimetres (19.7\u00a0in) TL), this species likes solitude, is relatively peaceful as an aquarium fish and does well with cichlids and other big fish, and should be kept in large tanks only and with plenty of rocks and driftwood in which to hide. Like many other plecos, it is very important in the aquarium trade. P. multiradiatus has been introduced to Taiwan,[2] Puerto Rico,[3] Florida, Hawaii, Texas, India, and Mexico,[4] most likely as the result of escapes or releases from aquarium fish farms. This species is firmly established in these and other locations, where it is regarded as a harmful invasive species being relatively inedible to people and predators, causing damage to fishing gear, competing and harming against native species and disrupting environments by its burrowing activities.[4] In this context its relative, Hypostomus plecostomus, has also been similarly implicated though it seems likely that in Asia, both or related species are implicated."

The zebra oto was described in 2004 from a tributary of the R\u00edo Ucayali in Peru.[2] Its closest relatives appear to be O. huaorani, O. bororo, O. mariae, and O. mura, as well as the more recently described species O. batmani.[3] This fish is found in Peru in the Ucayali River and possibly Mara\u00f1\u00f3n River as well. These fish are found in mid-sized creeks with clear water. It may also be found in small ponds.[1] They associate with marginal vegetation.[2] The zebra oto has a general body-shape like other Otocinclus species. They are small, have a suckermouth, and have armor on their bodies. The zebra oto can be distinguished from all other members of this genus by its vertical stripe-like blotches and its complete lateral line. The zebra oto has the highest number of teeth of any species of Otocinclus. The W mark on its caudal fin distinguishes this fish from all others except for O. batmani. The zebra oto reaches about 4.4\u00a0cm (1.7\u00a0in) in SL, though the males are smaller.[2] The zebra oto is listed as endangered by the IUCN Red List due to its limited range and overexploitation for the aquarium trade. Additionally, it is not protected in any part of its range, nor is it listed on CITES. The species has a decreasing population trend in the wild.[1] The zebra oto has been for sale in the aquarium trade since the early 1990s. It has been popular since at least 2000.[2] They are an occasionally seen species, and are bred in Asia in good numbers.[4]"

        "description": " Panaqolus maccus, commonly called the clown panaque, clown plecostomus, clown pleco, or ringlet pleco, is a dwarf loricariid. By numbering systems such as the L-number system, this fish may also be known as L104, L162, or LDA22.[1] This fish is endemic to Venezuela where it is found in the tannic Apur\u00e9 and Caron\u00ed River basins.[2] Their natural environment is driftwood tangles near riverbanks.[1] This species is a small loricariid. It reaches a length of 8.8 centimetres (3.5\u00a0in) SL.[2] This species has a striped pattern. However, this colouration may change with age. There are specimens with straight bars, but there are also specimens with a broken or wavy pattern. The wavy pattern form is found in the actual Orinoco and its tributaries in Bolivar State, Venezuela, while the \"normal\" patterned P. maccus comes from further north and west (Cojedes, Portuguesa, Guarico, and Apure States) in the Llanos where the drainages run into the Apure River.[1] Panaqolus maccus is one of the most common species of small, striped loricariids available in the fishkeeping hobby. This species adapts well to aquarium life.[1] They are not too difficult to spawn.[1] It should always be provided with enough driftwood in the tank, as it is a wood-eating fish. However fresh vegetables, spirulina and frozen foods such as bloodworms are recommended to be given as well from time to time. They are very peaceful fish suited for the average community tank. They are a hardy species of catfish and can tolerate various water parameters but prefer softer, more acidic water. Good filtration is needed because of the large amounts of waste they produce, caused by their wood-based diet. It is suited for tanks starting from 15 gallons.[1] It is difficult to successfully breed these fish in captivity. The tank setting and water parameters must be as near to their native habitat as possible. Seasonal changes can be simulated by adjusting the pH and temperature of the water. Soft driftwoods and cave formations give ample hiding places for the females to feel comfortable, and they may deposit eggs at some point.[3]"

        "description": " The redtail catfish, Phractocephalus hemioliopterus, is a pimelodid (long-whiskered) catfish. In Venezuela, it is known as cajaro, in Guyana, it is known as a banana catfish, and in Brazil, it is known as pirarara,[2] stemming from the Tupi language words pir\u00e1 and arara.[3] It is the only extant species of the genus Phractocephalus. This fish is common in the aquarium trade, although its massive adult size makes it unsuitable for all but the largest aquariums.[4] They feed on fish, crustaceans and fallen fruits.[5] They are not evaluated by IUCN. Although the redtail catfish is the only living representative of this genus, there are other members that date back to the upper Miocene, and are only known from fossil remains. P.\u00a0nassi was described in 2003, from the Urumaco Formation at Urumaco, Venezuela. Another fossil species, P.\u00a0acreornatus, is known from the Solim\u00f5es Formation, Acre, Brazil.[1][2] This genus has a minimum age of about 13.5\u00a0million years.[2] Phractocephalus hemioliopterus can reach about 1.8\u00a0m (5\u00a0ft 11\u00a0in) in length, and about 80\u00a0kg (180\u00a0lb) in weight.[6] However, this is exceptionally rare, and most do not approach this size. They average 3\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in\u00a0\u2013 4\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in; 1.1\u20131.4\u00a0m in length. These colorful large catfishes have a brownish back, with yellow sides, and characteristic orange-red dorsal fin and caudal fin (hence the common name). Sometimes the dorsal, pelvic and anal fins are also red. They have a broad head with long whiskers, dark black body and white underneath that extends from the mouth to the caudal fin. It has a pair of barbels on the upper jaw, and two pairs on the lower jaw. Their whiskers are sensitive and have chemical reception cells which are used as the sense of smell. They breed using external fertilization after laying their eggs. They communicate by making a clicking sound to warn off potential dangers.[5] The redtail catfish is native to the Amazon, Orinoco, and Essequibo river basins of South America, in Ecuador, Venezuela, Guyana, Colombia, Peru, Suriname, Bolivia, and Brazil.[2] It is found only in fresh water, and inhabits larger rivers, streams, and lakes.[7][4] They eat during the evening and night and stay motionless during the day. They are bottom-dwellers and move about quite slowly. Red-tailed catfish are territorial fish.[5] Redtail catfish is also an invasive species in Malaysia; they are now found mostly in the Perak River and Pahang River.[citation needed] Due to the potential large size of this species, redtail catfish are considered a game fish by anglers. The current IGFA world record for weight belongs to the Brazilian Gilberto Fernandes with 56\u00a0kg (123\u00a0lb 7\u00a0oz).[8] It is said that the natives do not eat the meat of the redtail catfish because it is black in coloration.[9] In Thailand, it is an alien species that has been introduced by humans, like the common pleco, zebra tilapia, and alligator gar.[10]\nIn some places, it is feared because it has been believed to be the cause of the mysterious drownings of many of the passengers aboard the passenger ship Sobral Santos II when it sank. The redtail catfish is an extremely popular fish in Amazonian-themed exhibits at public aquaria, where they are often housed with other large fish, such as Colossoma macropomum or pacu, and other large catfish. Juveniles are often available as aquarium fish, despite their eventual large size. In an aquarium where they may be well-fed, these fish can grow quite rapidly,[9] and require tanks of at least 10,000\u00a0L (2,600\u00a0US\u00a0gal) when fully mature.[4] Weekly feeding is appropriate for this catfish; overfeeding is a common cause of death in this species.[11] It feeds heavily on live and dead fishes and other meat. Even as a juvenile of only a few inches in length, they are able to swallow many of the more common aquarium fish (such as tetras or guppies), and it is only appropriate to house this fish with other species of relatively large size. Redtail catfish also have a habit of swallowing inedible objects in the aquarium. Though these are often regurgitated, both the swallowing and the regurgitation can present a problem for the fish, and these objects are best kept out of the aquarium.[11] The redtail catfish has been hybridized with other fish, such as the Pseudoplatystoma or Tiger Shovelnose Catfish, through the use of hormones, in attempts to create a viable food fish: the Tiger Redtail Catfish. These hybrid fish sometimes make it into the aquarium hobby under a variety of common names.[11]"

Pictus catfish are sometimes mislabeled as Angelicus cats in the aquarium trade, but the latter name actually refers to an unrelated  African catfish, the mochokid Synodontis angelica.[1] Pimelodus pictus should not be confused with Leiarius pictus, a much larger (60\u00a0cm) pimelodid. Pimelodus pictus, like other members of the Pimelodidae, are known for having extremely long barbels. These can extend all the way to the caudal fin. The fish are silver-colored with black spots and stripes. They have sharp spines on their dorsal and pectoral fins, which makes shipping a difficult task, since the spines can pierce plastic bags and get caught in nets. There is relatively little sexual dimorphism, with females being slightly larger than males.[2] Like many catfish, P.\u00a0pictus has a downturned mouth and a forked tail.[3] These fish are active swimmers and, like many catfish, nocturnal bottom feeders.[1] Two forms are known; a large-spotted form and a small-spotted form. Of the two, only the large-spotted form is commonly seen in the aquarium trade; it does not grow as large as the small-spotted form.[3] In captivity, these fish prefer soft water and are omnivorous; pictus cats eat bloodworms, beef heart, insects, vegetables, and prepared fish foods. They will also eat very small fish such as neon tetras, depending on the size of the catfish. Despite this, they are generally non-aggressive and will not harm fish too large for them to eat. A larger tank is required as these fish are agile and fast swimmers. They are also non-territorial and can be kept with other P. pictus. Besides the mildly venomous sting imparted by the dorsal spine, they are generally harmless to humans. In the wild, Pimelodus pictus has an estimated average trophic level of 3.19.[4]"

They become sexually mature at 56\u00a0cm (22\u00a0in), males at 45\u00a0cm (18\u00a0in)[3] and this species reaches a maximum length of 90\u00a0cm (35\u00a0in) TL.[1] Fecundity seems to be estimated at 8 million eggs per kg,[4] but was recently measured in aquaculture at a lower, and more likely number of 150,000 eggs laid per kg.[3] According to Riehl and Haensch, five subspecies have been described:[5] However, Buitrago\u2013Su\u00e1rez and Burr place P. f. brevifile, P. f. intermedium, and P. f. nigricans, in the synonymy of P. punctifer. P. f. reticulatum is elevated as another distinct species P. reticulatum.[1] Previously, all subspecies except P. f. reticulatum were considered synonyms of P. fasciatum.[2] The species is of interest for aquaculture for food production (and indirectly as conservation measure because it may lower the fishing pressure on wild population), as well as for production of fish.\nMaturation in earthen tanks of fish caught in the wild is not problematic, since manipulation of fish during fishing and transportation is well done.\nReproduction may be obtained with two injections of Ovaprim\u00ae in 24 hours (10% and 90% of the recommended dosis, respectively), ovulation occurs after around 8 hr at 27\u00a0\u00b0C.[3] Incubation of eggs is carried out in \"Zug\" jars and hatching occurs 24 hours after fertilization at 26,5\u00a0\u00b0C. Vitelus resorption takes 3 days but larvae start feeding 2 days after hatching, and may start active cannibalism at this moment. Feeding may start 48 hours post-hatching with freshly hatched artemia nauplii, seven times a day. Larvae must be kept in the dark in order to maximize uniform distribution of larvae in the tanks and therefore food availability.[6] After 15 days, food may be completed and then replaced gradually with ground mammalian liver. After 20 days post hatching, fingerling may be fed high quality pelleted food adapted to their size.  This Pimelodidae-related article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it."

The sides have a white band, bordered below by a dark gray or brown band. The venter is usually white with some large spots. The dorsal fin and adipose fin are spotted.[7] However, in juveniles, the snout is short and the pectoral fins are large and rounded. The white band does not appear until the fish is about 40\u00a00m (1.6\u00a0in).[clarification needed] The full adult color pattern and fin shapes appear by at least 20\u00a0cm (8\u00a0in).[7] This fish is mainly nocturnal.[5] Firewood catfish are highly predatory and feed on other fish.[6]"

        "description": " Synodontis multipunctatus, also known as the cuckoo catfish, cuckoo squeaker, or multipunk, is a small catfish from Lake Tanganyika, one of the lakes in the Great Rift Valley system in Africa. It is a brood parasite upon mouthbrooding cichlids.  This species grows to a length of 27.5 centimetres (10.8\u00a0in) TL.  This species is a minor component of local commercial fisheries.[2] Synodontis multipunctatus is one of a number of species of upside-down catfish in Lake Tanganyika, which is more famous for its cichlids. It gathers in large schools at depths of about 40 metres (130\u00a0ft) in the lake. S. multipunctatus is notable for its breeding behaviour - it is a brood parasite, similar to the cuckoo from which it takes its common name. Lake Tanganyika is home to a number of mouthbrooding cichlids, which care for their eggs and young by carrying them in their mouth. S. multipunctatus uses these, particularly Ctenochromis horei and Simochromis babaulti, as unwitting caretakers for their children. The smell of spawning cichlids excites S. multipunctatus into spawning, and as the cichlids lay their eggs the catfish will quickly slip in and eat the eggs before they can be collected by the mother. While doing so they also release and fertilise their own eggs. The female cichlid will hastily attempt to scoop up her eggs and, in doing so, will also collect eggs from S. multipunctatus. These eggs will then hatch inside the unwilling adoptive mother's mouth, and proceed to eat the cichlid eggs present before being released by the cichlid. This technique removes the burden of parental care from the S. multipunctatus, and allows them to breed again sooner. Synodontis multipunctatus are a popular addition to cichlid aquariums. They grow to about 15 centimetres (5.9\u00a0in), and can be bred in captivity provided suitable hosts are present. Some aquarists have had success with host cichlids from Lake Malawi and Lake Victoria as well as those from Lake Tanganyika.[3] They can be very aggressive and territorial towards other Synodontis species, they should be kept in groups over 3 to avoid competition between two, and proper cover and cave-like structures should be provided. They seem to be active in the day as much as the night and can prove quite lively. If kept in larger groups territorial issues are less likely.

        "description": " Synodontis petricola, known as the cuckoo catfish,[2] or the pygmy leopard catfish,[3] is a species of upside-down catfish endemic to Burundi, Zambia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Tanzania where it is only known from Lake Tanganyika.[2][4]  It was first described by Belgian ichthyologist Hubert Matthes in 1959.[4]  The species name \"petricola\" is derived from a combination of the Latin petra, meaning stone or rock, and the Latin cola, meaning inhabitant.  This refers to the rocky environment where this species is found.[3] Like all members of the genus Synodontis, S. petricola has a strong, bony head capsule that extends back as far as the first spine of the dorsal fin.[5] The head is about 3\u204410 of the standard length of the fish.[4] The head contains a distinct narrow, bony external protrusion called a humeral process.[3] The shape and size of the humeral process helps to identify the species. In S. petricola, the humeral process is triangular, rough, and is covered in many small, thin papillae.[4] The bottom edge has a poorly-defined ridge on the bottom edge, and the top edge is convex.[4] The humeral process ends in a sharp point.[4] It is about 1\u20442 of the length of the head.[4] The diameter of the eye is about 1\u20449 of the length of the head.[4] The fish has three pairs of barbels. The maxillary barbels are on located on the upper jaw, and two pairs of mandibular barbels are on the lower jaw. The maxillary barbel has a narrow membrane attached near the base and is straight without any branches.[4] It extends at least as far as the base of the pectoral spine, about 3\u20444 of the length of the head.[4] The outer pair of mandibular barbels extends just past the start of the pectoral girdle, about 1\u20442 of the length of the head,[4] and contains four to seven simple branches, usually without any secondary branches.[4] The inner pair of mandibular barbels is about 1\u20443 to 2\u20443 as long as the outer pair, about 1\u20444 of the length of the head,[4] with four to six branches, with many secondary branches present.[4] The skin of S. petricola has a large number of tiny vertical skin folds. The exact purpose of the skin folds is not known, but is a characteristic of the species of Syndontis that are endemic to Lake Tanganyika.[4] External granular papilla are present on the head, but not the body.[4] The front edges of the dorsal fins and the pectoral fins of Syntontis species are hardened into stiff spines.[3] In S. petricola, the spine of the dorsal fin is long, about 3\u20444 as long as the head,[4] is slightly curved, is smooth on the front and with fine serrations the back, and ends with short, white filament.[4] The remaining portion of the dorsal fin is made up of seven dark branching rays.[4] The spine of the pectoral fin is slightly curved, roughly as long as the dorsal fin spine, with large serrations on the back side.[4] The pectoral spine ends in short, white filament.[4] The rest of the pectoral fins are made up of eight to nine branching rays.[4] The adipose fin is large, does not contain any rays, and has a convex shape.[4] The pelvic fin contains one unbranched and six branched rays.[4] The front edge of the pelvic fin is vertically aligned midway between with the back edge of the dorsal fin and the front edge of the adipose fin.[4] The anal fin contains three to four unbranched and seven to nine branched rays; it is vertically aligned with the center of the adipose fin.[4] The tail, or caudal fin, is forked, with rounded lobes, and contains eight rays on the upper lobe, nine rays on the lower lobe.[4] The mouth of the fish faces downward and has wide lips that contain papilla.[4] All members of Syndontis have a structure called a premaxillary toothpad, which is located on the very front of the upper jaw of the mouth. This structure contains several rows of short, chisel-shaped teeth. In some species, this toothpad is made up of a large patch with several rows in a large cluster. In other species of Syndontis, this toothpad is clearly divided into two separate groups, separated by a thin band of skin that divides the toothpad.[4] This character is used as a method of differentiating between to different but similar species of Syndontis.[4] In S. petricola, the toothpad is interrupted, or clearly divided between the groups of teeth on the toothpad.[4] On the lower jaw, or mandible, the teeth of Syndontis are attached to flexible, stalk-like structures and described as \"s-shaped\" or \"hooked\".[3][5] The number of teeth on the mandible is used to differentiate between species; in S. petricola, there are 31 to 50 teeth on the mandible, arranged in a six short rows.[4] Some of the species of Synodontis have an opening or series of openings called the axillary pore. It is located on the side of the body below the humeral process and before the pectoral fin spine. The exact function of the port is not known to scientists, although its presence has been observed in seven other catfish genera. Fish in the genus Acrochordonichthys have been observed to secrete a mucus with toxic properties from their axillary pore, but there is no scientific consensus as to the exact purpose of the secretion or the pore.[4] S. petricola has a small axillary pore just below the humeral process.[4] The back of the fish is yellowish to copper-brown and is covered with large, irregularly-shaped black spots.[4]  In juveniles, these spots can appear larger and sometimes intersect.[4] The underside of the fish is lighter, with small, irregularly shaped spots.  Most of the species of Synodontis of Lake Tanganyika have a recognizable pattern consisting of dark triangles at the bases of all of the rayed fins, present in S. petricola, and the back edges of the fins are white in color.[4] The caudal fin has a black bar that runs from the base of each lobe to the top of the fin.[4] The barbels are white.[4] The maximum standard length of all known specimens is 11.5 centimetres (4.5\u00a0in) and a total length of 13.5 centimetres (5.3\u00a0in).[2][4] In general in Synodontis species, females tend to be slightly larger than males of the same age.[6] In the wild, the species is endemic to Lake Tanganyika, which has a temperature range of 23 to 26\u00a0\u00b0C (73 to 79\u00a0\u00b0F), and an approximate pH of 8.5 \u2013 9, and dH range of 4-15.[7] It inhabits rocky shorelines in the littoral zone, to a maximum depth of 30 metres (98\u00a0ft).[4] The reproductive habits of most of the species of Synodontis are not known, beyond some instances of obtaining egg counts from gravid females.[4] Spawning likely occurs during the flooding season between July and October, and pairs swim in unison during spawning.[8] Juveniles appear to be carnivorous, feeding on water mites, seed shrimp, and insect larvae. Adults feed on algae scraped from rocks as well as small invertebrates.[4] The growth rate is rapid in the first year, then slows down as the fish age.[6] The pygmy leopard catfish practices brood parasitism. It lives among rock piles frequented by various species of mauna: small African cichlids. Courtship behaviour culminates with the female sucking sperm from the male's cloaca. She brings the sperm through her digestive tract to her cloaca, where her eggs meet the sperm. She then rushes into the nest of a cichlid, devours the eggs, and deposits her own. The cichlids then raise the catfish as their own. Data related to Synodontis petricola at Wikispecies"

It was originally described in 1891 by Belgian ichthyologist Louise Schilthuis after its discovery in the Malebo Pool of the Congo River.[3]   The specific name \"angelicus\" means heavenly or divine, since juveniles of this species are remarkable for their bright coloring.[3] Adult specimens between 9 and 18 centimetres (3.5 and 7.1\u00a0in) are grey to dark violet, with reddish-yellow to bark brown-red blotches on the head, sides, adipose fin, and partly running together on the ventral surface.[3]   These blotches are evenly distributed and have sharp, distinct edges.[3]   The blotches may be edged with dark violet.  The fins are dark violet with brownish blotches and streaks.[3]   Juveniles between 4 and 9 centimetres (1.6 and 3.5\u00a0in) are strikingly colored, with white, round blotches on a red-violet background.[3] The first ray of the dorsal fin and the pectoral fins have a hardened first ray which is serrated.[2]   The caudal fin is deeply forked with an extension on the top lobe.[2][3]   It has short, cone-shaped teeth in the upper jaw.[2] In the lower jaw, the teeth are s-shaped and movable.[2] This species grows to a length of 25 centimetres (9.8\u00a0in) SL although specimens up to 55 centimetres (22\u00a0in) TL have been recorded in nature.[1] The species is commercially used as an aquarium species.[4]  The polka-dot African catfish is mostly nocturnal.[3] These catfish will excavate the substrate and may nibble plants. They eat smaller live foods and prepared foods. They prefer a water temperature of 24 to 28\u00a0\u00b0C (75 to 82\u00a0\u00b0F), a pH of 6.0\u20138.0 and a hardness of 5\u201319 dGH.[1] Data related to Synodontis angelicus at Wikispecies"

The type specimen is in the Mus\u00e9um National d' Histoire Naturelle de Paris.[4] Like all members of the genus Synodontis, S. nigrita has a strong, bony head capsule that extends back as far as the first spine of the dorsal fin.[5]  The head contains a distinct narrow, bony, external protrusion called a humeral process.[2] The shape and size of the humeral process helps to identify the species. In S. nigrita, the humeral process is as much longer than it is broad, with a ridge on the bottom edge, and with a pointed back end.[4] The fish has three pairs of barbels. The maxillary barbels are on located on the upper jaw, and two pairs of mandibular barbels are on the lower jaw. The maxillary barbel is long and straight without any branches, with a broad membrane at the base.[4] It extends to a length about 1 to 1+2\u20443 times the length of the head.[4] The outer pair of mandibular barbels is about twice the length of the inner pair, and both pairs have short, simple branches.[4] The front edges of the dorsal fins and the pectoral fins of Syntontis species are hardened into stiff spines.[2]  In S. nigrita, the spine of the dorsal fin is straight or slightly curved, 3\u20444 to 1 times the length of the head, smooth in the front and serrated on the back.[4] The remaining portion of the dorsal fin is made up of seven branching rays.[4] The spine of the pectoral fin about the same size as the dorsal spine, and serrated on both sides.[4] The adipose fin is 2+2\u20443 to 3 times as long as it is deep.[4] The anal fin contains four unbranched and eight to nine branched rays.[4] The tail, or caudal fin, is deeply forked, with the upper lobe slightly longer.[4] All members of Syndontis have a structure called a premaxillary toothpad, which is located on the very front of the upper jaw of the mouth. This structure contains several rows of short, chisel-shaped teeth.  In S. nigrita, the toothpad forms a short and broad band.[4]   On the lower jaw, or mandible, the teeth of Syndontis are attached to flexible, stalk-like structures and described as \"s-shaped\" or \"hooked\".[2][5] The number of teeth on the mandible is used to differentiate between species; in S. nigrita, there are about 30 to 35 teeth on the mandible.[4] The body color is brown or olive to blackish, with round black spots likely.  The fins are greyish to blackish; the caudal fin has black spots or black cross bars.  Juveniles are brown, with black spots.[4] The maximum total length of the species is 33.5 centimetres (13.2\u00a0in).[3]  Generally, females in the genus Synodontis tend to be slightly larger than males of the same age.[6] In the wild, the species has been found throughout northern Africa.  In central Africa, it has been recorded in the Ubangui River basin and the central Congo River basin.  In eastern Africa, it is found in Lake Albert and possibly Lake Kyoga.  In northern Africa, it is possibly present in Egypt.  In northeast Africa, it occurs in the White Nile from Khartoum into the Jebel and Ghazal River systems, as well as the Baro River.  In western Africa, the species is known from the Chad River basin, the Niger River basin, the Volta River, the Senegal River, the Gambia River, the Geba River, the Oueme River, and the Casamance River.[1]  The reproductive habits of most of the species of Synodontis are not known, beyond some instances of obtaining egg counts from gravid females.[7] Spawning likely occurs during the flooding season between July and October, and pairs swim in unison during spawning.[8]   As a whole, species of Synodontis are omnivores, consuming insect larvae, algae, gastropods, bivalves, sponges, crustaceans, and the eggs of other fishes.[7]  The growth rate is rapid in the first year, then slows down as the fish age.[6] Data related to Synodontis nigrita at Wikispecies"

These fish are adapted to spend most of their time upside-down. This is reflected in the fish's pigmentation \u2013 their bellies are darker than their backs, a form of countershading.[3] These fish have lighter colors on the top of their bodies and darker colors below used for camouflage. The lighter colors on the top of them make it harder for predators to see the fish when looking up toward the sky but only when the fish are swimming upside-down.[4] Synodontis nigriventris are mostly nocturnal, and feed on insects, crustaceans, and plant matter.[2] These fish lay eggs.[2] The young fish do not swim upside-down until they are about two months old.[5] Adults swim and rest upside down in the water. They swim faster when upside down, and are more likely to be upside down around objects or at the water bottom. The more objects around the fish, the more they tend to swim upside down.[4] When close to an object, the fish puts its ventral side closest to the object.[4] It rarely swims in the middle of the water, preferring to swim either at the bottom or at the surface.[6] By swimming upside down when it feeds,[7] it can readily catch prey at the surface from beneath.[4] The blotched upside-down catfish is well suited to aquariums because of its small size (typically 9 or 10\u00a0cm or less) and peaceful demeanor.[3] Data related to Synodontis nigriventris at Wikispecies"

The giraffe catfish is found throughout Africa in lakes and rivers, partially due to introduction and establishment in other areas.[2] It is found in many important lakes and rivers such as the Nile and Lake Chad. Its distribution covers includes bodies of water from East Africa to West Africa. It generally lives in shallow waters with muddy bottoms.[1] This fish has a maximum size that sources say are between two and three feet. The giraffe-like pattern will fade with age to a two-tone mottled brown. Various subspecies have been described for this fish, indicating some geographical variation in coloration.[2] Eggs are scattered in a nest and guarded by the male. Dinotopterus cunningtoni takes advantage of the care and allows the male giraffe catfish to care for its eggs and young, an example of interspecific brood care.[1] The giraffe catfish is occasionally imported for the aquarium trade. Because of its large eventual size and its fast rate of growth, it is inappropriate for smaller aquaria. This fish will readily accept a variety of foods and is tolerant of a wide variety of water conditions. They will scavenge the aquarium looking for food, which could cause in the uprooting of plants.[2] This fish is also an important food fish in Africa.[2]"

It uses its power to defend itself and to capture prey. In Africa, it occurs in the Nile and tropical Africa (exclusive of Lake Victoria), Lake Turkana, Lake Chad and Senegal basins. Occurs among rock favors standing water. Active at night, feeding mainly on fish stunned by electric shocks. The electric organ, capable of discharging 300-400 V, is derived from pectoral muscle and surrounds almost the entire body. It is used both for prey capture and defense. This is an Old World catfish. It is reputed that Doctors in ancient Egypt used shocks from the Electric Catfish to reduce the pain of arthritis. This trait is still used today in some areas. It also has the earliest reference of them as hieroglyphics on the walls of ancient Egyptian tombs some 5,000 years ago.[citation needed] Malapterurus electricus is eaten as food in parts of Africa. Being a food fish, M. electricus is also encountered in the pet trade as an aquarium fish. The electric organs of Malapterurus have been used in studies of neuronal metabolism, axonal transport. In their natural habitat they form pairs and lay their eggs in excavated cavities or holes. The male takes the eggs into his mouth. There have been rumours that they are mouth brooders. It is also unknown how the fry is immune to the electric shocks by the parents. Malapterurus electricus is sometimes encountered in aquarium supply stores. It can reach a maximum length of over 1 meter (3\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in) in the wild, but has an average size of 12 inches (30\u00a0cm) in the aquarium. It is quite hardy and greedily accepts most foods, although some experimentation may be required to find the best food. The only other animals that are compatible with this species are snails, which they will ignore. A minimum aquarium size of 55 US gallons (210\u00a0L; 46\u00a0imp\u00a0gal) is required, with bogwood or pieces of PVC pipe. They are active burrowers and will often remove the gravel from under their favorite hiding spot. A minimum temperature of 75\u00a0\u00b0F (24\u00a0\u00b0C) is necessary.[citation needed] It is illegal to possess any species of electric catfish for personal or commercial use in Florida.[2]"

        "description": " Kryptopterus vitreolus, known in the aquarium trade traditionally as the glass catfish[1][2] and also as the ghost catfish or phantom catfish, is a small species of Asian glass catfish. It is commonly seen in the freshwater aquarium trade, but its taxonomy is confusing and was only fully resolved in 2013.[1] It is endemic to Thailand, and found in rivers south of the Isthmus of Kra that drain into the Gulf of Thailand and river basins in the Cardamom Mountains.[1]  There are also unconfirmed reports from Penang in Malaysia.[2] Until 1989, it was considered to be the same as the \"glass catfish\" Kryptopterus bicirrhis, a larger species infrequently seen in the aquarium trade.[1] Subsequently, the ghost catfish commonly seen in the aquarium trade was believed to be the same as K. minor, but in 2013 it was established that the aquarium specimens actually represented another species, which was described as K. vitreolus.[1] The true K. minor, which is restricted to Borneo, has rarely (if ever) entered the aquarium trade.[1] This is a transparent freshwater catfish with two long barbels. Standard lengths may range up to 8\u00a0cm (3.1\u00a0in), but usually only reach around 6.5\u00a0cm (2.6\u00a0in) in total length.[1] They are transparent because, like all catfish, they are scaleless, and catfish within the genus Kryptopterus lack body pigment. Most of their organs are located near the head; with a magnifying glass, their heart can be seen beating. When the light strikes the fish just right, it can create an iridescent rainbow color. During strong illness and after death, they turn milky white. The scientific species name vitreolus is derived from the Latin vitreus, which means glass.[1] Among described species of Kryptopterus, only two other species, K. minor and K. piperatus, have clearly transparent bodies and both these are largely \u2013 if not entirely \u2013 absent from the aquarium trade.[1] The body of others, including K. bicirrhis, are only somewhat translucent or opaque.[1] The aquarium trade in K. vitreolus generally relies on wild-caught specimens, and there are concerns that this may be unsustainable due to the volume and its limited range.[1] Unlike many other aquarium fish, it is not known to be bred at commercial facilities.[1] K. vitreolus reacts to electromagnetic fields owing to a protein encoded by Electromagnetic Perceptive Gene (EPG).[3]"

        "description": " Wallagonia leerii, also known as the Great Tapah, helicopter catfish, and formerly the striped wallago catfish is a species of catfish native to Southeast Asia. Its habitat ranges from the river drainages of Thailand through the Malayan peninsula to the islands of Sumatra and Borneo in Indonesia.[1] It can grow up to 2\u00a0m (6\u00a0ft 7\u00a0in) in length and weigh up to 150\u00a0kg (330\u00a0lb).[1] It has been used as food in Southeast Asia since ancient times.[2] Overfishing for its prized meat has caused the population to significantly decrease. Furthermore, the breeding migration pattern of this fish is especially vulnerable to damming, which has also decreased the wild population significantly. Until osteological research validated the genus Wallagonia in 2014, W. leerii was included in the genus Wallago.[1] The other two species of the genus Wallagonia, the Lesser tapah from the Mekong river basin and the Spotted tapah from the Kinabatangan river basin on Borneo, are currently considered as distinct species. There are, however, strong suspicions that these may in fact be subspecies of W. leerii, as the sole difference seems to lie in a slightly different coloration.[1] The Great Tapah is a large fish, commonly attaining lengths of 150 centimetres and a mass of up to 86 kilograms. The size of this fish however can easily exceed the aforementioned lengths.[3]  It is the second-largest catfish in its family and is only outsized by the wels, Giant pangasius and Mekong giant catfish. It has a short, rounded body and a long broad tail, the anal fin of the fish is about as long as the tail itself and it ends in a forked caudal fin. The pelvic fins of the fish are small, and there are no dorsal spines on it. The Great Tapah possesses a noticeable hump, atop sits its dorsal fin, which is small and almost elliptical. The head of this fish is long, and remarkably wide with a huge lower jaw that extends beyond its maxilla. The mouth of the catfish is inlaid with several rows of sharp teeth that enable it to grip prey. It is a piscivore, primarily feeding on small fish which are snatched mid-swimming and consumed whole. The Great Tapah faces a multitude of threats, as it is vulnerable to destructive fishing, competition with invasive species, destruction of suitable habitat, and dam construction that impact its lifecycle.[4] Splitting of species within the complex may give doubts to the true abundance of the species, meaning it could be far more restricted than once thought. In July, adults migrate downstream to flooded grasslands to spawn. At night, the eggs are spawned near the surface.[5]  This catfish-related article is a stub.

        "description": " The walking catfish  (Clarias batrachus) is a species of freshwater airbreathing catfish native to Southeast Asia. It is named for its ability to \"walk\" and wiggle across dry land, to find food or suitable environments. While it does not truly walk as most bipeds or quadrupeds do, it can use its pectoral fins to keep it upright as it makes a wiggling motion with snakelike movements to traverse land.[2] This fish normally lives in slow-moving and often stagnant waters in ponds, swamps, streams, and rivers, as well as in flooded rice paddies, or temporary pools that may dry up. When this happens, its \"walking\" skill allows the fish to move to other aquatic environments. Considerable taxonomic confusion surrounds this species and it has frequently been confused with other close relatives.[3][4] One main distinction between the walking catfish and the native North American ictalurid catfish with which it sometimes is confused, is that the walking catfish lacks an adipose fin.[5] It can survive 18 hours out of water. [6] The walking catfish has an elongated body shape and reaches almost 0.5\u00a0m (1.6\u00a0ft) in length and 1.2\u00a0kg (2.6\u00a0lb) in weight.[3] Often covered laterally in small white spots, the body is mainly coloured a gray or grayish brown.[5] This catfish has long-based dorsal and anal fins,[5] as well as several pairs of sensory barbels. The skin is scaleless, but covered with mucus, which protects the fish when it is out of water. This fish needs to be handled carefully when fishing it due to its embedded sting or thorn-like defensive mechanism hidden behind its fins (including the middle ones before the tail fin, similar to the majority of all catfishes). The walking catfish is a tropical species native to maritime Southeast Asia. The native range of true Clarias batrachus is confirmed only from the Indonesian island of Java, but three closely related and more widespread species frequently have often been confused with this species. These are C. magur of northeast India and Bangladesh, a likely undescribed species from Indochina, and another likely undescribed species from the Thai-Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, and Borneo.[3][4] Both of these undescribed species have been referred to as, Clarias aff. batrachus.[3] At present, the taxonomic position of the Philippines population (called hito or simply \"catfish\" by the locals) is unclear, and it also is unclear whether South Indian populations are C. magur or another species.[4] As a consequence, much information (behavioral, ecological, related to introduced populations, etc.) listed for C. batrachus, may be for the closely related species that have been confused with true C. batrachus.[4] True C. batrachus, C. magur and the two likely undescribed species are all kept in aquaculture.[4] Walking catfish thrive in stagnant, frequently hypoxic waters,[5] and often are found in muddy ponds, canals, ditches, and similar habitats. The species spends most of its time on, or right above, the bottom, with occasional trips to the surface to gulp air.[5] In the wild, this creature is omnivorous; it feeds on smaller fish, molluscs, and other invertebrates, as well as detritus and aquatic weeds. It is a voracious eater that consumes food supplies rapidly, so it is considered harmful when invasive.[7] Within Asia, this species has been introduced widely.[3] It has also been introduced outside its native range where it is considered an invasive species. It consumes the food supplies of native fish and preys on their young. It also is regarded as an invasive species because they can destroy fish farms. In the United States, it is established in Florida.[8] It is reported in California, Connecticut, Georgia, Massachusetts, and Nevada.  \nThe walking catfish was imported to Florida, reportedly from Thailand, in the early 1960s for the aquaculture trade.[5] The first introductions apparently occurred in the mid-1960s when adult fish imported as brood stock escaped, either from a fish farm in northeastern Broward County or from a truck transporting brood fish between Dade and Broward Counties. Additional introductions in Florida, supposedly purposeful releases, were made by fish farmers in the Tampa Bay area, Hillsborough County in late 1967 or early 1968, after the state banned the importation and possession of walking catfish. Aquarium releases likely are responsible for introductions in other states. Dill and Cordone (1997) reported this species has been sold by tropical fish dealers in California for some time. They also have been spotted occasionally in the Midwest. In Florida, walking catfish are known to have invaded aquaculture farms, entering ponds where they prey on agricultural fish stocks. In response, fish farmers have had to erect fences to protect ponds. Authorities have also created laws that ban possession of walking catfish. In 2017, Clarias spp. were recovered from the River Tonge, near Bolton, Northern England.[9] In Indonesia, it is commonly referred as lele, or when needing distinction; lele jawa or lele kampung, compared to lele dumbo or lele sangkuriang which refers to the introduced C. gariepinus. It is the main ingredient in several traditional dishes, such as pecel lele and mangut lele. In Thailand, Clarias aff. batrachus is known as pla duk dan (Thai: \u0e1b\u0e25\u0e32\u0e14\u0e38\u0e01\u0e14\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19). It is a common, inexpensive food item, prepared in a variety of ways. It often is offered by street vendors, especially grilled or fried.[10] This fish is also one of the most common freshwater catfish in the Philippines, which as aforementioned is known as hito in the local language. Despite this, current evidence of Clarias aff. batrachus populations from other regions of southeast Asia and India in relation towards C. batrachus have not been thoroughly studied.[clarification needed] A white variation with black patterns is commonly seen in the aquarium fish trade. However, this color variation also is prohibited where walking catfish are banned. Very well-rooted plants and large structures that provide some shade should be included in an aquarium with these fish. Any small tankmates will be eaten by this fish."

There is a dorsal fin with a hard spine as well as an adipose fin.[5] There are four pairs of barbels, one nasal, one maxillary (sides of the mouth), and two mandibular (chin).[5] The body is yellowish with black shoulder spot surrounded by a lighter outline.[6]  This fish can reach a length of 45 centimetres (18\u00a0in) TL.[7] H. brachysoma is known from the Kerala Backwaters, Vembanad Lake, Chalakudy River, Nethravathi River of south Karnataka.[8] and the Uttara Kannada district of India.[5]  They occur in smooth flowing areas with much vegetation. H. brachysoma is found in smooth flowing areas with much vegetation. Periyar river in Kerala state is the best habitat but now they are commonly seen in the Chalakudy River due to the less disturbed habitats. The population genetic structure of this species has been studied extensively by using genetic markers.[9][10]  This species occupies lowland areas of rivers and backwaters with mud or sand substrate. It has also been recorded in deep pools and hill streams.[2]\nThe diet of H. brachysoma has been studied. It is an unspecialized feeder and eats a variety of meaty foods. Food items include crustaceans, molluscs, and fish. Adults may consume terrestrial insects and even frogs. Stomachs of these fish contain detritus which is indicative of its bottom-feeding habits.[3] This flexible diet is beneficial in its variable habitat, in which food availality is affected by monsoons.[3]  Feeding rate is known to increase during the breeding season in the months following the monsoon season.[3] Spawning occurs before the monsoons and finishes by the southwest monsoon in the summer.[2] H. brachysoma is an important food fish in India and is also sold in the aquarium trade. The IUCN considers H. brachysoma to be a vulnerable species, while other have considered it to be an endangered species.[11] Overexploitation, habitat alteration, pollution and related anthropogenic pressures on their natural habitats have considerably reduced populations of this species by 60\u201370% during the last few years.[3]"

        "description": " Helicophagus hypophthalmus Sauvage, 1878\nPangasius sutchi Fowler, 1937[3]\nPangasius hypophthalmus (Sauvage, 1878) The iridescent shark, iridescent shark catfish[4] (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus) is a species of shark catfish (family Pangasiidae) native to the rivers of Southeast Asia. Despite its name, it is not a shark. It is found in the Mekong basin as well as the Chao Phraya River, and is heavily cultivated for food there. The meat is often marketed under the common name swai (from Thai \u0e2a\u0e27\u0e32\u0e22). It has also been introduced into other river basins as a food source, and its striking appearance and iridescence have made it popular with fishkeeping hobbyists, among whom it is also known as the Siamese shark catfish or sutchi catfish.[5] The swai's omnivorous diet consists of crustaceans, other fish, and plant matter.[6] The fish is named for the glow or iridescence exhibited in juveniles, as well as the shark-like appearance of this and other shark catfish. Adults reach up to 130\u00a0cm (4.3\u00a0ft) in length and can weigh up to a maximum of 44\u00a0kg (97\u00a0lb). They have a shiny, iridescent color that gives these fish their name. However, large adults are uniformly grey. The fins are dark grey or black. Juveniles have a black stripe along the lateral line and a second black stripe below the lateral line.[6] Iridescent sharks originate from the large rivers Chao Phraya and Mekong in Asia, though they have been introduced into other rivers for aquaculture. They are a freshwater fish that natively live in a tropical climate and prefer water with a 6.5\u20137.5 pH, a water hardness of 2.0\u201329 dGH, and a temperature range of 22\u201326\u00a0\u00b0C (72\u201379\u00a0\u00b0F).[6] They can tolerate hypoxic conditions thanks to their swim bladder which can be used as an air-breathing organ.[7] They prefer large bodies of water similar to the deep waters of their native Mekong river basin. The iridescent shark is a migratory fish that in most regions moves upstream to spawn during the flood season while the waters are high and returns downstream to seek rearing habitats when the river water levels recede. The dates of the migrations vary depending on the river system. In the Mekong river basin, they migrate upstream in May to July and return downstream during September through December. South of the Khone Falls, upstream migration occurs in October to February, with its peak in November to December; here, it appears to be triggered by receding waters at the end of the flood season.[6] In August 2015, an environmental group in Santander, Colombia, confirmed that iridescent sharks had been found in one of the tributaries that feed into the Magdalena River, having been accidentally introduced from illegal farm fisheries in the area. The find has caused alarm amongst the scientific community and government officials, as the Magdalena river is home to over 200 native fish species, 35 of which are endangered.[8] Disruption to these sharks can come from many physical stressors, including but not limited to shear forces, rapid decompression, blade strike and turbulence. These can lead to and have led to an increase in the Injury and mortality rate of these sharks. This is a sad reality[citation needed] since these injured can be caused by hydropower developments which are being put into place to combat the global climate crisis that is being faced.[9]\nIridescent sharks are also introduced to other Southeast Asia countries for food, especially Peninsular Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and Myanmar. In Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia they are called ikan patin (which 'ikan' means fish in Malay and Indonesian), Malaysian Chinese prefer them steamed or cooked in whole, while Malay prefer cooking these fishes with Tempoyak and curry.[10] Pangasius does not have a gourmet reputation and is sold cheaply as swai (/swa\u026a/, from Thai \u0e2a\u0e27\u0e32\u0e22 s\u0304w\u0101y)[11][12] in the United States, panga (or pangas) in Europe and cream dory and basa in several Asian countries and in Australia and the UK. Despite its lowly reputation, the total export of pangasius from Vietnam reached US$1.8 billion in 2014.[13] Pangasius fillets are an increasingly popular product because of their low cost, mild taste and firm texture. Recipes for other whitefish such as sole or halibut can be adapted to pangasius.[14] Pangasius is an omnivorous fish, and thus does not require a high level of animal protein in its diet. Typical grading sizes are 3\u20135\u00a0oz (85\u2013140\u00a0g), 5\u20137\u00a0oz (140\u2013200\u00a0g), and 7\u20139\u00a0oz (200\u2013260\u00a0g).[15] While juvenile iridescent sharks are sold as pets for home aquariums, they are not easy fish to keep. Iridescent sharks are schooling fish that prefer groups,[6] are accustomed to living in rivers, and are active fish that require space. They have very poor eyesight, so detected movement from outside of their habitat can be seen as a threat. If stressed, their first instinct is to flee; a blind dash can cause injury in an aquarium environment. These injuries may result in the fish sinking to the bottom, where it may lie on its side or back until it recovers.[16] Iridescent sharks require a minimum tank size of 12\u00a0m (39\u00a0ft) to develop naturally. Schools require even larger tanks. If given enough room and fed adequately, they can reach 1\u00a0m (3.3\u00a0ft) in length. In most home aquaria, the lack of space stunts their growth. For this reason, most iridescent sharks kept in home aquaria grow to  15 to 30\u00a0cm (6 to 12\u00a0in) in length only and may die prematurely. When provided adequately sized aquaria and proper husbandry, iridescent sharks may live into their teens and grow to full size.[17]"

        "description": " The giant pangasius, paroon shark, pangasid-catfish[1] or Chao Phraya giant catfish (Pangasius sanitwongsei) is a species of freshwater fish in the shark catfish family (Pangasiidae) of order Siluriformes, found in the Chao Phraya and Mekong basins in Indochina. Its populations have declined drastically, mainly due to overfishing, and it is now considered Critically Endangered.[1] The specific name sanitwongsei was chosen to honor M. R. Suwaphan Sanitwong (Thai: \u0e21.\u0e23.\u0e27.\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e27\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e23\u0e13 \u0e2a\u0e19\u0e34\u0e17\u0e27\u0e07\u0e28\u0e4c) for his support of fisheries in Thailand.[2] The species is native to the Mekong and Chao Phraya rivers that run through China, Cambodia, Thailand, Viet Nam, and the Lao People's Democratic Republic. It has been introduced to central Anatolia,[3] South Africa,[4] and Malaysia.[5] The Pangasius sanitwongsei is tolerant of poor quality water,[4] mainly in brackish waters, and prefers to live in the bottom of deep depressions in freshwater rivers.[6][failed verification] The fish live in rivers but are experiencing endangerment due to dams being built, causing the fish to be trapped and unable to migrate.[7] There are currently two sub-populations of Paroon Shark separated by the Khone Falls which they do not migrate over.[8] The Giant Pangasius is a ray-finned fish part of the family Pangasiidae commonly known as Shark Catfishes. They are recognized for having both dorsal and ventral long fins, which help stabilize the fish and keep it upright.[9] This adds to their bilateral symmetry corresponding to their developed swimming ability. Its skin is pigmented with dusky melanophores that help with camouflage in bottom waters. It has a wide, flat, whiskerless head. Its body is compressed and elongate, with a depressed head.[10] It has a continuous and uninterrupted single vomero-palatine teeth patch which is curved.[11] The anal fin has 26 rays and the pectoral spine is similar in size to the dorsal spine and also shows serrations.[10] It has a silver, curved underside and a dark brown back.  Its dorsal, pectoral and pelvic fins are dark gray and the first soft ray is extended into a filament. Its dorsal, adipose, pectoral, and caudal fins are a dark grey to black coloring, with its anal fin and pelvic fins a white to grey coloring.[4] Full-grown adults can reach 300 centimetres (9.8\u00a0ft) SL in length and weigh up to 300\u00a0kg (660\u00a0lb).[12] More commonly the fish's length is around 2 meters.[6] Little is known of the reproduction of P. sanitwongsei, but the time of spawning happens in the months of April and May.[6] It is predicted that spawning happens in the rivers where they are found; they are not believed to be migrating from outside the river when getting ready to spawn.[13] Eggs and sperm are usually released in a muddier area to prevent eggs from sticking to each other.[14] The number of eggs per each spawning is around 600 (with a diameter of 2-2.5mm) and the brood shows low genetic variation.[6] There is no parental care after spawning.[15] The giant pangasius is a benthopelagic and migratory species. Juveniles and adults feed on crustaceans and fishes. These fish typically spawn just prior to the monsoon season.[12] It is believed that the P. sanitwongsei prey on shrimp, crabs, and fish and hideout in deep areas in rivers.[6] The P. sanitwongsei have a seasonal migration but the fish does not leave the river during its migration, it only stays within the river during the seasonal migration.[16] The P. sanitwongsei is a carnivorous fish, whose prey consist of shrimp, crabs, and fish.[6] Since the fish lives on the bottom, it is also known to feed on larger animals' carcasses.[4] Due to it being both an apex predator and a bottom-dwelling fish, it limits the populations of smaller fish as many catfish species. This fish's lifespan isn't known, but it is known that it grows fast[4] and usually the trend is when it grows fast, it dies quickly.[citation needed] The possible reasoning for this could be the fact that there is over-fishing of the species.[3] The P. sanitwongsei's role in the ecosystem is the top predator, therefore inflicts top down control on the population. Top predators aid in the limitation of smaller organisms and in this case they prey on smaller fish keeping the smaller fish in check. Without these carnivorous predators, the smaller fish could overpopulate and throw the food chain into imbalance.[17]  Due to overharvesting, the native fish population may increase since the P. sanitwongsei population is declining.[18] This fish is important to many locals that reside in the regions where the rivers run through as this is an important food source. Many fishing villages rely on the organisms that reside in the river to provide food for their family as well as a source of income as they can sell them at markets. Due to this fish's large known range, it can show us migratory pathways and spawning habits and areas that should be protected, and other areas that can be harvested.[6] This species of fish is also important to fisheries as it can grow to large sizes, even in captivity, and build an economy that relies heavily on fish and other water species. This was a significant reason why it was introduced to rivers in South Africa.[4] These fishes are also valuable asset in the pet trade. They are considered exotic organisms as they are not commonly found in aquariums and are not domesticated. This introduced species in South African rivers can also be a case of release from aquariums once they could no longer be contained due to their high energy need and large size.[4] Fishing of this species used to be accompanied by religious ceremonies and rites. It is often mentioned in textbooks, news media, and popular press. This fish is a popular food fish and marketed fresh.[12] They were introduced to Malaysia for both food and as an ornamental fish. These fish sometimes appear in the aquarium fish hobby. Most specimens do not reach their full size without an extremely large aquarium or pond. There is even a \"balloon\" form of this fish where the fish has an unusually short and stocky body.[19] In addition to fishing for religious purposes, they are also hunted for sport as they are the largest of their kind. They are considered trophy fish and are hunted for prestige and fame. The downside is that these individuals are the most fecund and mature which leads to a decrease in population if too many are harvested at one time. This further makes them a topic of conservation as they play key roles in their ecosystem.[20] This fish is highly protected and has a high conservation value and is banned from being fished through all seasons.[21] The fish is being threatened by overharvesting, damming of rivers, and pollution. Their population continues to decline as there are not many legislations and enforcement toward this species. A common threat to these large organisms is dams and segmentation of the Mekong River. The Paroon shark travels upstream to spawn and resides downstream. The construction of dams leads to segmentation of the natural habitat.[22] Even though the bodies of water are interconnected these fish are not capable of swimming through walls to get to their natural breeding sites. Aside from being threatened by anthropogenic causes, the Giant Pangasius is considered an umbrella species in conservation. Protecting this species would provide protection for species that inhabit the same region. With this tactic, a whole ecosystem can be preserved. Due to this area being an area that is highly fished commercially and locally, certain regulations can be put in place to manage the size of the fish that can be caught allowing mature adults to reproduce with greater success. [23] A known breeding practice, to try and help the population, is being practiced by the Thai government.[6] A halt on harvesting has been recommended until the P. sanitwongsei's population can rise to a safe level.[6] Even though these fish are grown in a safe fishery, this can reduce the genetic diversity between them making them more susceptible to disease as well as environmental stress. To control the amount of overharvesting (via fishing) that occurs certain size and catch limits can be put in place. In 1989, the Paroon shark was listed as a class II protected species by the government of Yunnan, China.[8] The issue is that the habitat of this species lies in multiple countries' domains including Cambodia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Thailand, and Viet Nam. Restrictions in parts of the river that reside in China's territory, leave the other parts to be unprotected. There are some groups in the Asian continent who have been trying to protect and conserve the wildlife in these regions including the Asian Species Action Partnership (ASAP), Species Survival Commission (SSC), World Wildlife Fund (WWF), and International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN).[24]"

It may also be called Southern striped Raphael, talking catfish, chocolate doradid, chocolate catfish or thorny catfish.[1] It is native to the Amazon, Paraguay\u2013Paran\u00e1 and lower Orinoco basins in South America.[2] This peaceful, nocturnal species is a popular aquarium fish due to its pleasant temperament and curious nature.[3] Despite its name \"talking catfish\", it does not speak. This catfish has long been confused with Platydoras costatus of Suriname and French Guiana, where the pale stripe on the body does not extend onto the head.[2] These fish burrow in the soft river bottoms and frequently occurs on sandy bottoms.[4] These fish feed on mollusks, crustaceans and organic debris.[4] They have rigid pectoral fin spines. The striped Raphael catfish also has tiny and curved protective spines running along its body. The typically reported maximum standard length of this species is 20\u201324\u00a0cm (7.9\u20139.4\u00a0in).[5][6] Considerably larger individuals, up to 43\u00a0cm (17\u00a0in) long, have been reported from the Tocantins\u2013Araguaia basin,[4][7] but this population, together with those from the Tapaj\u00f3s and Xingu, likely represent an undescribed species (not to be confused with P. birindellii, a species from the Xingu basin that was described in 2018).[2][8] Juvenile striped raphael catfish have been recorded cleaning piscivorous fish such as Hoplias cf. malabaricus. The stripe pattern in the young may serve as a signal that allows for its recognition as a cleaner. It is noted that the striping pattern is not as strong in adults, and so the cleaning behavior is probably only seen in juveniles.[9] The striped Raphael catfish is a fine and sociable community fish that are peaceful to fellow catfishes and other fish species.[3] However, they are nocturnal, and are usually not visible during the day.[3] It is best not to catch the striped Raphael catfish with a fish net because they are prone to sticking out their pectoral fin spines in a very rigid manner, especially if stressed. Untangling these spines from a net is difficult and dangerous to both handler and fish. Alternative methods should be used.\nAlthough known as a spawning fish, sexual differences are unknown and there have been no reports of being successfully bred in captivity.[3] Because of this, these fish must be wild-caught, and therefore related species of similar appearance sometimes appear in the hobby, such as Orinocodoras eigenmanni, which differs in a longer snout.[3]\nThe Raphael catfish will make some grunting/squeaking noises while out of water.\nAlthough generally sociable with other fish, sometimes this fish can feed on smaller fish so take care when introducing one to an established tank."

It is native to the Rio Negro and Orinoco  basins in Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela,[1][2] where mostly found in slow-moving waters with many submerged structures.[3] It is currently the only recognized species of the genus Asterophysus,[4] but a specimen that possibly represents an undescribed species has been collected in Maraj\u00f3 (about 1,200\u00a0km or 750\u00a0mi from the traditionally recognized range of A. batrachus).[5] The gulper catfish grows to a standard length of 25\u00a0cm (9.8\u00a0in),[1] and a total length of 28.5\u00a0cm (11.2\u00a0in).[6] It has a short, thick-set shape and is dark-colored with a whitish belly.[6] People in its native range typically will not eat it because they consider it very ugly,[7] but it is sometimes kept in aquariums.[8] The gulper catfish is a strict carnivore and swallows its prey, mostly other fish, whole. This prey can be exceptionally large for its size, sometimes even larger than the gulper catfish itself,[8] although such feeding attempts can be unsuccessful.[3] The catfish catches prey by biting on the head. Escaping out of the mouth is generally prevented by the fine, backwards-pointing teeth of the catfish. Instead the struggles of the prey cause it to be further engulfed and eventually ending up folded (with both its head and tail pointing towards the predator's head) in the greatly extendable gulper catfish stomach.[6][9] The fully extended stomach may result in an abnormal appearance of the gulper catfish to the point where its swimming can be impaired. It may also swallow large amounts of water only to expel it later along with remains of earlier prey.[6] Potential prey fish are apparently unable to recognize the gulper catfish as dangerous because fish will not generally consider other fish of roughly similar size as a major threat, and because of its slow, unobtrusive approach.[6][9] A common observed attack is the catfish quickly turning to the side and biting on the head of the targeted fish. Even if the first attempt fails, the gulper catfish will not try to pursue it. The prey will typically still not realize that the catfish represents a threat and can be caught using the same approach.[6] Another method of catching prey was observed by a snorkeler in the Atabapo River. Here the gulper catfish live in crevices between rocks and dart out to catch passing prey such as angelfish.[10] In aquariums gulper catfish will feed during both day and night, but it is suspected the species is nocturnal and crepuscular in the wild, giving it an additional advantage when hunting along river banks for its often sleeping prey.[6]"

The male's fins are black, as is the female's dorsal fin; the female's pelvic, anal, and \nadipose fins are reddish in color. A long-finned variety, apparently developed by captive breeders, is sometimes sold in the aquarium trade (the male has elongated dorsal and anal fins even in the wild form). The black phantom tetra reaches a maximum standard length of 3.6\u00a0cm (1.4\u00a0in).[2] The male black phantom tetras have longer fins than the females and when in breeding condition, the females become plumper, but the biggest difference is in their color. The males have no red, while the smaller fins of the female both on the top and underneath them are red. The adipose fin, on the top of the body behind the larger dorsal fin, is much more noticeable in the females than the males, because in females it is red while in the males it is grey. The female's dorsal fin has a more intense black than the male's. When the fish are in breeding condition, the colors of both sexes become more distinct, with the male showing its black fins more obviously. The black phantom tetra's natural diet consist of small crustaceans, insects, and worms.[2] H. megalopterus is one of the more popular tetras sold in the aquarium trade. While it is not particularly colorful, it makes up for this by its display behavior: the males are territorial and defend their space against their neighbors by presenting themselves in profile with the dorsal and anal fins fully extended, and the dark color intensified, making the edging of the body patch stand out prominently. Sometimes they exchange blows which can tear the fins, but this damage heals quickly. Unlike other tetras who prefer to live in large shoals, they will also do fine when kept in a group of four or five individuals, making them suitable for smaller aquaria. They still need enough space for the males to stake territories and present themselves to best effort, however. The fish should be well conditioned to induce spawning. When possible, live foods are included in the conditioning period. Frozen foods like bloodworms are also used as conditioning food. The Black phantom tetra is an egg-scattering species.[4] To stimulate breeding, pH is lowered to about 5.5-6, the general hardness of the water is also reduced below four degrees. The breeding tank should have plants, both rooted and floating, and low light. A female black phantom tetra will produce about 300 eggs. These fish will eat their own eggs and fry, so the parents are usually removed after spawning.[4] The fry become free-swimming after five days.[4] They are fed infusoria (protozoa) at first. Commercial fry foods of suitable sizes can be used but at all stages the young fish benefit from live food of the right size."

        "description": " The black neon tetra (Hyphessobrycon herbertaxelrodi) is a freshwater fish of the characin family (Characidae) of the order Characiformes. It is native to the Paraguay basin of southern Brazil. They are often found in the aquarium trade. The species is named in honor of pet-book publisher Herbert R. Axelrod (1927-2017), whose Tropical Fish Hobbyist magazine published this description and several others by G\u00e9ry.[2] This species is of typical elongated tetra appearance; it is of plain basic\ncoloration, but with two distinct, adjacent, longitudinal stripes; white above\nblack. The eye has two thin but distinctive color bands across the top; red\nabove yellow. It grows to a maximum overall length of approximately 4\u00a0cm (1.6\u00a0in). Befitting its common name, it slightly resembles the neon tetra, which belongs to a different genus (Paracheirodon) The fish's natural diet consists of small invertebrates and plants. H. herbertaxelrodi is commonly kept as an aquarium fish by hobbyists. The black neon tetra is sometimes called the black tetra, but that name more\nproperly refers to a different species, Gymnocorymbus ternetzi. Black neon tetras are kept in soft acidic water.[3] Aquarists recommend that the water be kept clean at all times; that the tank contain live plants, a darker substrate and open water for swimming; and that the fish  be kept in groups of at least 6, preferably more.  The recommended minimum aquarium volume for a group of 6 is about 15 US gallons (60 L), and for a group of 8-10 fish, about 20 gallons. Because black neon tetras swim at the top level of the aquarium, and do not feed from the bottom of the tank, aquarists keep them with bottom dwelling fish (such as pygmy corydoras) so that leftover food is then eaten up off the substrate and not left to waste. Black neon tetras are fed a variety of foods, including flake, frozen and freeze dried food. Small live foods like worms and brine shrimp are said to bring out the fish's colors. Black neon tetras can be spawned rather easily if the water quality is right. Before attempting to breed the black neon tetra, breeders condition the prospective parents with live food. Fish around one year old can be suitable for breeding. The sex of the fish is determined by its body shape, the female being much rounder and more plump than the males.[3]\nAlthough the black neon tetra can be kept in water harder and more alkaline than its natural habitat, for breeding it is necessary to be closer to what it would feel like in the Amazon. Breeding the Black neon tetra requires acidic water with no more than four degrees of hardness. The black neon tetra is an egg scatterer, laying adhesive (sticky) eggs over plants, etc.[3] One female can produce several hundred eggs. The parents eat their own eggs, so the parents are normally removed after spawning.[3] As with many fish, the black neon tetra often spawns in the early morning.\nRaising the fry can be more difficult because of their small size. The first food will normally be protozoa (infusoria), then Daphnia. Usually very fine fry food is used, graduating to slightly coarse fry food. At all ages, the black neon tetra benefits from suitably sized live food."

It is native to the Paraguay River basin of south-central Brazil (mainly Pantanal region), Paraguay and northeast Argentina, but there are also populations in the upper Paran\u00e1 and Para\u00edba do Sul Rivers that likely were introduced.[1] It was formerly reported from the Guapore River, but this population is part of G. flaviolimai, which is found throughout the Madeira River basin and was described in 2015.[1] The black tetra is often kept in aquariums.[2] Growing up to 7.5\u00a0cm (3.0\u00a0in) in length,[3] the black tetra has a roughly tetragonal body shape and is greyish in colour, fading from near black at the tail to light at the nose. Two prominent, black, vertical bars appear just posterior to the gills.[1] It is easily distinguished from all of its congeners by the presence of a dense field of dark chromatophores spread homogeneously over the posterior one half of the body unlike the lack of such pigmentation in all congeners.[4] The black widow tetra is a shoaling fish that feeds on small crustaceans, insects, and worms.[3] The black skirt tetra is a common fish that is widely available for purchase. Hobbyists often provide live foods such as Daphnia and mosquito larvae, and frozen foods like bloodworms.[citation needed] The species reaches sexual maturity at about two years of age. Like most characins, this species spawns by intermittently releasing and fertilizing eggs among plants. It frequently eats its own eggs, so keepers remove the fish after spawning. The lifespan in captivity is 3 to 5 years. The black tetra was also used to make genetically modified fish sold as GloFish (fluorescent colored fish), available in a wide variety of colors. The black phantom tetra (Hyphessobrycon megalopterus) is a separate species. The black neon tetra (Hyphessobrycon herbertaxelrodi) is sometimes also called the black tetra."

Bloodfin tetras are extremely hardy, making them popular with novice fish keepers. Bloodfin tetras are typically kept in schools of five or more. They swim mainly in the upper and middle water layers and are highly sociable fishes, mixing well with other types of tetras and tropical fish in general, so are often kept (like many other tetras) in a community tank. However, they will tend to nip at the fins of fish with long, wavy fins, such as angelfish or guppies. Bloodfin tetras have also been kept in cold-water tanks, provided the temperature does not drop below room temperature. They have been kept in temperatures ranging from 64\u201383\u00a0\u00b0F. Tetras are adapted to soft, slightly acidic water, and soft water is essential for breeding. Bloodfin tetras can adapt to many water conditions in captivity, if the tap water is dechlorinated.[citation needed] At the time of spawning the fish leaps above the water surface and leaves its eggs in the water. The eggs, being heavy, fall to the floor of the tank or water body. The female deposits 300\u2013500 eggs.[citation needed] "

It is not a safe tank mate for fellow tetras, because it will eat small fish, nor is it a safe tank mate for larger species, because it is a notorious lepidophage.  Bucktooth tetra are best kept alone or in large planted tanks that provide adequate protective coverage for other species. They are best kept in shoals of eight or more; a shoal of fewer than eight will pick at each other and stress the exodons to a point where it will either catch a  disease or die of severe wounds.

        "description": " Hyphessobrycon anisitsi The Buenos Aires tetra (Psalidodon anisitsi)[1] is a tropical fish from South America. It was first observed in the wild in 1907, by Carl H. Eigenmann. An aquarium subject for over 60 years, the Buenos Aires tetra is a well loved aquarium fish, often admired for its flashy red color. The Buenos Aires tetra originates from its namesake, South America. They are found in South America in the La Plata region of Argentina, Paraguay, and southeastern Brazil.[2] In the wild, they are commonly found in rivers, ponds, lakes, and streams, namely, in the La Plata region. They are a freshwater fish, and do not do well in conditions that may offer too salty or too filthy water. They swim in schools and are a social fish, always together with their own kind. The tetra is a tropical, silver metallic-colored fish, with red-tipped fins and a black marking on the dorsal fin. The tetra is a hardy community fish for beginners, and is optimal for the beginning fish hobbyist.[2] It is also relatively large for a tetra, growing up to 7.5\u00a0cm (3 inches).[2] They can live up to 5 or 6 years. Its silver color picks up flashy neon highlights depending on how the light hits the fish. The top and bottom of the tail fin is generally red, along with the pelvic and anal fins. The dorsal fin may also have a hint of red at the very tip. Its most distinguishing characteristic is the caudal peduncle, or the connecting area between the tail and the rest of the body, which features a bold, black 'cross' shape.[2] The Buenos Aires tetra are very durable, and do not have any special needs or requirements. A maintained freshwater tank and food is all that they really need. However, they are hearty feeders that must be well-fed or they may begin to nip at their long-finned tank-mates. Keeping the tetras in a school of 5 or more definitely decreases aggression. This species can occasionally nip at and eat aquarium plants.[2] Buenos Aires tetras are an omnivorous species. In the wild they feed on worms, crustaceans, insects, and plants, but in the aquarium they will generally eat all kinds of live, fresh, and flake foods. To keep a good balance, give them a high quality flake food every day. To keep these tetras at their best and most colorful, offer regular meals of live and frozen foods, such as bloodworms, Daphnia, and brine shrimp. Vegetables should also be added to their diet. Feed these tetras several times a day and only what they can consume in 3 minutes or less at each feeding.[2] Buenos Aires tetras breed occasionally in an aquarium setting. They breed by scattering their eggs into their environment,[3] hoping that they will be fertilized and lead to young. When breeding does occur, a hospital or \"breeding tank\" will be necessary. For optimal breeding conditions, use slightly acidic water. Much like most other species of fish, once the eggs begin to hatch, removing the parents will reduce the number of lost fry, as the parents will soon begin to eat their young.[4] Once the eggs are laid, the fry will begin to hatch in about 24 hours. For the next three or four days, they will eat their egg sac and then become free swimming fry.[3]"

        "description": " The cardinal tetra (Paracheirodon axelrodi) is a freshwater fish of the family Characidae of order Characiformes. It is native to the upper Orinoco and Negro Rivers in South America. Growing to about 3\u00a0cm (1.2\u00a0in) total length, the cardinal tetra has the striking iridescent blue line characteristic of the genus Paracheirodon laterally bisecting the fish, with the body below this line being vivid red in color, hence the name \"cardinal tetra\". The cardinal tetra's appearance is similar to that of the closely related neon tetra, with which it is often confused; the neon's red coloration extends only about halfway to the nose, and the neon's blue stripe is a less vibrant blue. The cardinal tetra is a very popular aquarium fish, but is less widespread than the neon tetra because until recently, it was difficult to breed in captivity. However, many breeders are now producing the fish; in most cases, one can determine if the cardinal tetra is bred or wild-caught due to damaged fins on wild-caught specimens. Some ichthyologists believe fishkeepers should continue to support the sustainable cardinal fishery of the Amazon Basin, since thousands of people are employed in the region to capture fish for the aquarium trade. If those fishermen lost their livelihoods catching cardinals and other tropical fish, they might turn their attention to engaging in deforestation.[3] American ichthyologist Leonard Peter Schultz described the cardinal tetra in 1956 as Cheirodon axelrodi.[2] The specific epithet honors ichthyologist Herbert R. Axelrod. Hyphessobrycon cardinalis is an obsolete synonym. The fish's common name, cardinal tetra, refers to the brilliant red coloration, reminiscent of a cardinal's robes. P. axelrodi is also often called the red neon tetra. The species exists in a number of different color forms or phenotypes. A \"gold\" and \"silver-blonde\" form exists in the Rio Negro drainage that has less blue in the longitudinal stripe. The normal form from the Rio Negro drainage has a blue stripe, which extends to the adipose fin, while the Orinoco drainage phenotype has a stripe that stops posterior to the adipose. The Orinoco phenotype may represent a subspecies of P. axelrodi. The cardinal tetra has bright red ventral parts and an iridescent blue line that runs horizontally along its body. The characteristic iridescence of this and related fishes, such as the neon tetra, is a structural color, caused by refraction of light within guanine crystals that develop within special cells called iridocytes in the subcutaneous layer. The exact shade of blue seen depends on the viewing angle of the viewer relative to the fish - if the viewpoint changes so as to look at the fish more from below, the colour will change hue, becoming more deeply sapphire blue and even indigo. Change of viewpoint to one above the fishes, however, and the color becomes more greenish. Cardinal tetras appear to grow larger in captivity than they do in the wild.[4] They have a large stomach and small gut.[4] Cardinal tetras are found on the upper Orinoco and the Negro, which are located in Colombia and Venezuela and Brazil, respectively. The cardinal tetra forages in areas of slow-moving, shallow water. It is predominantly predatory, feeding on tiny animals found on underwater plants, roots, and leaf litter. Creatures commonly eaten include the larvae of chironomid midges and microcrustaceans such as water fleas (Cladocera) of the families Moinidae, Macrotrichidae, and Daphniidae, and copepods of the family Harpacticidae. Other organisms eaten include other fly larvae, insect eggs, rotifers, and testate amoebae.[4] The cardinal tetra, in the wild, swims upstream in large numbers to parts of its native river habitat completely enclosed above by rainforest canopy. Such waters are subject to heavy shading by the rainforest trees, and virtually no sunlight reaches them. Here, the fishes spawn in large aggregations.  If the fishes are ready to spawn, the male, which will be the slimmer of the two fishes in outline,  pursues the female into fine-leaved plants; her fuller outline, which usually indicates the presence of ripe eggs within her reproductive tract, should be readily apparent at this point. If the female is ready, she allows the male to swim alongside her, and together, the pair release eggs and sperm. The fish might also be effectively an annual species with a lifespan of just a single year in nature. It lives for several years in captivity. For those seeking to breed them in the aquarium, the best way to do so is by mimicking the same natural setup. \nA study conducted in Manaus, Brazil, subjected cardinal tetras to adverse water conditions for 96 hours. The fish perished at a low temperature of 19.6\u00a0\u00b0C and high of 33.7\u00a0\u00b0C, and pH below 2.9 or above 8.8.[5]"

        "description": " The Mexican tetra (Astyanax mexicanus), also known as the blind cave fish, blind cave characin, and blind cave tetra, is a freshwater fish of the family Characidae of the order Characiformes.[3][4] The type species of its genus, it is native to the Nearctic realm, originating in the lower Rio Grande and the Neueces and Pecos Rivers in Texas, as well as the central and eastern parts of Mexico.[3][5][6] Growing to a maximum total length of 12\u00a0cm (4.7\u00a0in), the Mexican tetra is of typical characin shape, with silvery, unremarkable scalation.[3] Its blind cave form, however, is notable for having no eyes or pigment; it has a pinkish-white color to its body (resembling an albino).[7] This fish, especially the blind variant, is reasonably popular among aquarists.[8] A. mexicanus is a peaceful species that spends most of its time in midlevel water above the rocky and sandy bottoms of pools and backwaters of creeks and rivers of its native environment. Coming from a subtropical climate, it prefers water with 6.5\u20138 pH, a hardness of up to 30 dGH, and a temperature range of 20 to 25\u00a0\u00b0C (68 to 77\u00a0\u00b0F). In the winter, some populations migrate to warmer waters. Its natural diet consists of crustaceans, insects, and annelids, although in captivity it is omnivorous.[3][8] The Mexican tetra has been treated as a subspecies of A. fasciatus, but this is not widely accepted.[3] Additionally, the hypogean blind cave form is sometimes recognized as a separate species, A. jordani, but this directly contradicts phylogenetic evidence.[7][9][10][11][12][13] A. mexicanus is famous for its blind cave form, which is known by such names as blind cave tetra, blind tetra (leading to easy confusion with the Brazilian Stygichthys typhlops), blind cave characin and blind cavefish. Depending on the exact population, cave forms can have degenerated sight or have total loss of sight and even their eyes, due to down-regulation of the protein \u03b1A-crystallin and consequent lens cell death.[14] The fish in the Pach\u00f3n caves have lost their eyes completely whilst the fish from the Micos cave only have limited sight.[15] \nCave fish and surface fish are able to produce fertile offspring.[15] These fish can still, however, find their way around by means of their lateral lines, which are highly sensitive to fluctuating water pressure.[16] Blindness in A. mexicanus induces a disruption of early neuromast patterning, which further causes asymmetries in cranial bone structure. One such asymmetry is a bend in the dorsal region of their skull, which is propounded to increase water flow to the opposite side of the face, functionally enhancing sensory input and spatial mapping in the dark waters of caves.[17] Scientists suggest that gene cystathionine beta synthase-a mutation restricts blood flow to cavefish eyes during a critical stage of growth so the eyes are covered by skin.[18] Currently, about 30 cave populations are known, dispersed over three geographically distinct areas in a karst region of San Luis Potos\u00ed and far southern Tamaulipas, northeastern Mexico.[9][19][20] Among the various cave population are at least three with only full cave forms (blind and without pigment),  at least eleven with cave, \"normal\" and intermediate forms, and at least one with both cave and \"normal\" forms but no intermediates.[19] Studies suggest at least two distinct genetic lineages occur among the blind populations, and the current distribution of populations arose by at least five independent invasions.[9] Furthermore, cave populations have a very recent origin (< 20,000 years) in which blindness or reduced vision evolved convergently after surface ancestors populated several caves independently and at different times.[21][22] This recent origin suggests that the phenotypic changes in cavefish populations, namely eye degeneration, arose as a result of the high fixation of genetic variants present in surface fish populations in a short period of time.[23] The eyed and eyeless forms of A. mexicanus, being members of the same species, are closely related and can interbreed[24] making this species an excellent model organism for examining convergent and parallel evolution, regressive evolution in cave animals, and the genetic basis of regressive traits.[25] This, combined with the ease of maintaining the species in captivity, has made it the most studied cavefish and likely also the most studied cave organism overall.[19] The blind and colorless cave form of A. mexicanus is sometimes recognized as a separate species, A. jordani, but this leaves the remaining A. mexicanus as a paraphyletic species and A. jordani as polyphyletic.[7][9][10][11][12][13] The Cueva Chica Cave in the southern part of the Sierra del Abra system is the type locality for A. jordani.[7] Other blind populations were initially also recognized as separate species, including antrobius described in 1946 from the Pach\u00f3n Cave and hubbsi described in 1947 from the Los Sabinos Cave (both subsequently merged into jordani/mexicanus).[7] The most divergent cave population is the one in Los Sabinos.[7][26] Another cave-adapted population of Astyanax, varying from blind and depigmented to individuals showing intermediate features, is known from the Granadas Cave, part of the Balsas River drainage in Guerrero, southern Mexico, but it is a part of A. aeneus (itself sometimes included in A. mexicanus).[7][20][27] The surface and cave forms of the Mexican tetra have proven powerful subjects for scientists studying evolution.[24] When the surface-dwelling ancestors of current cave populations entered the subterranean environment, the change in ecological conditions rendered their phenotype\u2014which included many biological functions dependent on the presence of light\u2014subject to natural selection and genetic drift.[25][28] One of the most striking changes to evolve was the loss of eyes. This is referred to as a \"regressive trait\" because the surface fish that originally colonized caves possessed eyes.[24] In addition to regressive traits, cave forms evolved \"constructive traits\". In contrast to regressive traits, the purpose or benefit of constructive traits is generally accepted.[25] Active research focuses on the mechanisms driving the evolution of regressive traits, such as the loss of eyes, in A. mexicanus. Recent studies have produced evidence that the mechanism may be direct selection,[29] or indirect selection through antagonistic pleiotropy,[30] rather than genetic drift and neutral mutation, the traditionally favored hypothesis for regressive evolution.[28] The blind form of the Mexican tetra is different from the surface-dwelling form in a number of ways, including having unpigmented skin, having a better olfactory sense by having taste buds all over its head, and by being able to store four times more energy as fat, allowing it to deal with irregular food supplies more effectively.[31] Darwin said of sightless fish:[32] By the time that an animal had reached, after numberless generations, the deepest recesses, disuse will on this view have more or less perfectly obliterated its eyes, and natural selection will often have effected other changes, such as an increase in the length of antennae or palpi, as compensation for blindness. Modern genetics has made clear that the lack of use does not, in itself, necessitate a feature's disappearance.[33][34]  In this context, the positive genetic benefits have to be considered, i.e., what advantages are obtained by cave-dwelling tetras by losing their eyes? Possible explanations include: Another likely explanation for the loss of its eyes is that of selective neutrality and genetic drift; in the dark environment of the cave, the eyes are neither advantageous nor disadvantageous and thus any genetic factors that might impair the eyes (or their development) can take hold with no consequence on the individual or species. Because there is no selection pressure for sight in this environment, any number of genetic abnormalities that give rise to the damage or loss of eyes could proliferate among the population with no effect on the fitness of the population. Among some creationists, the cave tetra is seen as evidence 'against' evolution. One argument claims this is an instance of \"devolution\"\u2014showing an evolutionary trend of decreasing complexity. But evolution is a non-directional process, and while increased complexity is a common effect, there is no reason why evolution cannot tend towards simplicity if that makes an organism better suited to its environment.[35] Inhibition of the HSP90 protein has a dramatic effect in the development of the blind tetra.[36] The blind cave tetras seen in the aquarium trade are all based on stock collected in the Cueva Chica Cave in the southern part of the Sierra del Abra system in 1936.[7] These were sent to an aquarium company in Texas, who soon started to distribute them to aquarists. Since then, these have been selectively bred for their troglomorphic traits.[7] Today large numbers are bred at commercial facilities, especially in Asia.[8] The blind cave tetra is a hardy species.[7] Their lack of sight does not hinder their ability to get food. They prefer subdued lighting with a rocky substrate, like gravel, mimicking their natural environment. They become semi-aggressive as they age, and are by nature schooling fish.[37] Experiments have shown that keeping these fish in bright aquarium set-ups has no effect on the development of the skin flap that forms over their eyes as they grow."

        "description": " The diamond tetra (Moenkhausia pittieri) is a small freshwater fish of the characin family (family Characidae) of order Characiformes. It is found in and around Lake Valencia in Venezuela, South America. This species exhibits clear sexual dimorphism, with males having much longer dorsal fins than the females. Males also tend to be more brightly coloured, but both sexes are attractive fish and have become popular with aquarists. The dorsal and anal fins are purple and the body is silver. The eye is marked with red above the pupil, and there is a dark band running along the midline of the body. Their common name comes from the bright, iridescent scales along the flanks. This species very much resemble Metynnis and Myleus species. Although the patronym was not identified, it is probably in honor of Swiss-born geographer-botanist Henri Fran\u00e7ois Pittier (1857\u20131950), who lived in Venezuela and collected some specimens for Eigenmann.[1] Diamond tetras are endemic to the northern area of Venezuela. They hail originally from the waters of Lake Valencia, located between the states Carabobo and Aragua, and its tributaries. They inhabit slow moving streams with abundant vegetation and leaf litter. These fish are threatened by urban growth, which destroys and pollutes their habitat. The species has seemingly disappeared completely from Lake Valencia, where they were collected initially. In 2009 the Venezuelan underwater photographer Ivan Mikolji was able to find and photograph a population of this fish in a stream nearby Lake Valencia.[2] The diamond tetra is an omnivore. In the wild they eat whatever they can forage, with a preference for small animal food items, especially mosquito larvae.\nIn a home aquarium they eat most standard fish foods, such as flakes and pellets. They benefit from a variety of food such as live daphnia or frozen bloodworms. A pair or group of diamond tetras will spawn in an aquarium with a shaded area, which can be created by including fine-leaved plants such as Java moss or a spawning mop. The fish should be well conditioned beforehand with nutritious food, preferably small live foods. Soft acidic water in the pH range\u00a0of 5.5\u20136.5 is preferred, and a temperature of around 26\u201329\u00b0C (80\u201384\u00b0F) is suitable. The fish usually spawn in the early morning. If not removed from the tank, the adults will eat their eggs. It is recommended to remove them after spawning. The eggs normally hatch within 36 hours and the fry are usually free swimming in around 4 days. Diamond tetra fry grow quickly. They can feed on pre-made fry foods, but suitably sized live foods will help at all stages of development.  This Characidae-related article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it."

        "description": " The ember tetra (Hyphessobrycon amandae) is a freshwater fish of the characin family (family Characidae) of\norder Characiformes. It is native to the Araguaia River basin of Brazil and was discovered in 1987 and named in honor of the fish explorer Heiko Bleher's mother (Amanda Bleher).[2] This species is of typical tetra shape but grows to a maximum overall length of approximately 2\u00a0cm (0.8\u00a0in).; Most exhibit striking orange and reddish coloration with mild translucency near the pelvic fin. The eye frequently mirrors the color of the fish and is outlined in black. The fish's natural diet consist of small invertebrates and plants. Although somewhat hard to find in fish stores, H. amandae is commonly kept as an aquarium fish by hobbyists. The minimum tank size requirement for the Ember tetras is at least 10 gallons with few live aquarium plants.[3] Ember tetras should be kept in acidic water with a pH near 6.6, and although their native habitat has very soft water they have adapted quite well to a wide range of hardness (5\u201317 dGH). The recommended temperature range is between 23\u201329\u00a0\u00b0C (73\u201384\u00a0\u00b0F). Ideally their tank should contain live plants, a darker substrate, and open water for swimming. Ember tetras should be kept in groups of at least 6, though recommended number is 9\u201310, in order to promote schooling. They appreciate a heavily planted aquarium, ideally with a small area shaded from direct light and will spend a lot of time swimming through planted areas, which also offer some protection for their fry. Ember tetras will school with other tetras, such as the neon tetra, but may become stressed by the presence of significantly larger fish. These fish swim at the middle level of the aquarium, and they don't feed from the bottom of the tank. Therefore, it is recommended that they are kept with other bottom dwelling fish (such as pygmy corydoras) so that leftover food is then eaten up off the substrate and not left to waste. Ember tetras can be fed a variety of foods, including flake, frozen, and freeze dried food. Small live foods like worms and brine shrimp are also recommended as they bring out the fish's colors. In a well maintained heavily planted aquarium, Ember tetras have been known to live ten years or more.  This Characidae-related article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it."

        "description": " Nematobrycon palmeri, commonly known as the emperor tetra, is a species of characid fish found in the Atrato and San Juan river basins in western Colombia. It was first imported in the aquarium trade to the United States in 1960 and has since become well established. Named in honor of Mervyn George Palmer (1882-1954), an English traveler who collected in Central and South America for the British Museum, and who collected the type specimen.[2] The purple hue of these tetras will be more apparent in an aquarium with floating plants on the surface and relatively subdued lighting. If the aquarium is too bright, the yellow coloration will dominate. The body is long, slim, and flattened to about 3 inches at maturity. Looking from the eye to the tail area, you will find a black line placed within a blue stripe. The sickled shaped dorsal fin, along with the pectoral fin and anal fins are yellow. The male is larger than the female and his anal fins are longer. The male caudal is more pointed than the female. Emperor tetras are highly sexually dimorphic and thus males and females are quite easily distinguished from each other. There are several ways to tell a male and female apart, the most reliable method is to observe the eye color. Males will have metallic blue eyes while females possess metallic green eyes. Also, the male has a three pronged tail with the medial black stripe usually extending beyond the rest of the tail, while in the females this median black stripe will typically only reach as far as the clear part of the tail. However, this is not always the best indicator as the third prong in males can sometimes be nipped off in competitions with tank mates and more dominant females may sometimes grow this extension of the tail as well. This species should not be confused with the royal tetra Inpaichthys kerri, whose appearance and alternate common names resemble N. palmeri. The emperor tetra is an omnivore, eating both animal and vegetable food.  Any good flake or pelleted fish food is a good basis for its diet. It will benefit from live food like daphnia and mosquito larvae as well as frozen fish food including frozen bloodworms. In a large well planted aquarium a single pair of emperor tetras will often breed without any extra stimulation.  If there are no other fish, some of the babies may survive especially if the parents are well fed. In a large, well planted aquarium the babies will find some useful natural food in the form of protozoa, algae, etc.  Screened daphnia will provide them with more nourishment as they grow, and dry fry food can be used. The emperor tetra is a placid aquarium fish and will be disturbed by more boisterous species. It grows to 4.2 \u00a0cm.[3] It prefers a pH of 6.5, a hardness of 3-6 dKH and a temperature of 23\u201327\u00a0\u00b0C.\nIt does not school as readily as most tetras, and a pair appears happier than with most tetras. However, with the addition of fresh cool water, a large group of emperors will school across an aquarium, sometimes for several minutes."

This tetra was first introduced as aquarium fish in 1920 by C. Bruening, Hamburg, Germany, and  formally described in 1924 by Dr. George S. Myers.[2][3] Today large numbers are bred in captivity and it is common in the aquarium trade,[4] but the remaining wild population in Southeast Brazil is highly threatened.[5][6] Cuba produced a postal stamp with an image of H. flammeus in 1978.[7] The flame tetra reaches about 2.5\u00a0cm (1\u00a0in) in standard length.[5][6][8] The rear half of the body is flame red while the area in front of the dorsal fin is silver crossed by two dark vertical bars. All the fins are red except for the pectoral fins, which are colourless. The tip of the anal fin on the male is black, while on the female the fins have less red colouration but darker tips of the pectoral fins. The flame tetra is native to Southeast Brazil, where it occurs in coastal parts of Rio de Janeiro (Guanabara bay region, and Para\u00edba do Sul and Guandu River basins) and S\u00e3o Paulo (upper Tiet\u00ea River basin).[5][6] It lives in rivers and streams, generally preferring shallow (less than 0.5\u00a0m or 1.6\u00a0ft deep), slow-flowing sections with vegetation and a water temperature from 22\u00a0to 28\u00a0\u00b0C (72\u201382\u00a0\u00b0F).[5] The species has declined drastically, mainly because of habitat loss, pollution and introduced species (especially tilapia and black bass).[5][6] Although sometimes reported as extinct in the wild,[8] wild populations survive.[5][6] In its small remaining distribution, it is common in the Tiet\u00ea River basin (which possibly is not natural, but introduced) and rare elsewhere.[5] The last confirmed record from Rio de Janeiro is from 1992.[6] The species is listed as endangered in the Brazilian national red list.[9] Today large numbers are bred in captivity and it is common in the aquarium trade.[4][6] This includes some selectively-bred forms (such as golden, orange and albino) that differ from the original wild form.[6] H. flammeus is a peaceful schooling fish, and will generally do well in groups.  H. flammeus has an omnivorous diet.[8]  The species will breed in captivity.[8]"

        "description": " Hemigrammus erythrozonus, commonly known as the glowlight tetra, is a small tropical fish from the Essequibo River, Guyana, South America. It is silver in colour and a bright iridescent orange to red stripe extends from the snout to the base of its tail, the front of the dorsal fin being the same color as the stripe. Other fins are silver to transparent. The glowlight tetra is a peaceful, shoaling fish. It is larger than the neon tetra, and its peaceful disposition makes it an ideal, and popular, community tank fish. It should be kept with similar sized, non-aggressive species. Hemigrammus gracilis is a senior synonym. The red-line rasbora (Rasbora pauciperforata) of Malaysia and Indonesia has markings and coloring very similar to H. erythrozonus, but is a member of family Cyprinidae, not a close relative. H. erythrozonus is a medium-sized tetra growing to 4 to 5\u00a0cm (1.6 to 2.0\u00a0in), notably larger than both neon and cardinal tetras. It has a life span of two to four years when kept in good conditions. In the wild, the fish eats aquatic insect larvae.[2] H. erythrozonus is readily available and usually inexpensive.[citation needed] Golden and albino varieties are also sold.[citation needed] It is best seen in the freshwater aquarium when kept in subdued lighting with a dark substrate.[3] The water should be soft to slightly hard, d\u00b0GH of 6\u00b0 to 15\u00b0, with a slightly acidic pH of 6.8, in the range 6.0 \u2013 7.5. It prefers a temperature of 25\u00a0\u00b0C in the range 22\u00b0 \u2013 28\u00b0 \u00b0C (72\u00b0 \u2013 82\u00a0\u00b0F).   \nThe hardiness of this fish allows it easily to adapt to harder water, though soft water is essential for captive breeding. H. erythrozonus is an omnivore and in the aquarium eats small live, frozen and dry foods and flake foods. The feeding of vegetable matter is suggested to vary the diet. Like all tetras, H. erythrozonus is happiest, most active, and most aesthetically pleasing when in a shoal. A minimum aquarium length of 60\u00a0cm will make them more comfortable when swimming. They prefer a well planted tank for hiding, but with some open water for free swimming. They should be a group of at least four with eight or more to make them feel secure. They tend to swim in tighter groups when a potential predator is present and swim freely when comfortable. They are often bought by aquarium owners to play a 'second fiddle' role to the neon tetra. Although they generally shoal separately from neon and cardinal tetras, they will sometimes shoal alongside the latter, making an arresting spectacle. Like most tetras, females are larger and more fat bodied than the more slender male. It may be hard to tell male from female until the fish are fully mature and females fill with eggs. H. erythrozonus breeds similarly to most egg-scattering small fish. It been bred in captivity with a moderate level of difficulty. Breeding tank set-up: A small 40l all-glass tank with soft water (hardness up to 8\u00b0dGH and carbonate hardness not higher than 2\u00b0dCH). Water temperature should be kept between 26 and 28\u00a0\u00b0C (79 and 82\u00a0\u00b0F). Adding peat to the tank or filter will soften water and make it slightly acidic. The tank should have dim or no lighting. Spawning is over fine-leaved plants. Java moss (Taxiphyllum barbieri) or Fontinalis are suggested but not mandatory, or a spawning mop made of woolen thread. Other commonly used plants include water wisteria and hornworts, as well as fox/coons tail. 1\u00a0cm glass beads or a spawning grate will help at the bottom to protect eggs from being eaten by adults, though they will have to spawn through the plants first, as the fine leaves act as a trigger. If spawned without fine leaved plants, the majority of eggs will result unfertilized. Parents' conditioning: Feed the pair kept separately with a variety of live foods, frozen food or dry food for a few weeks. When the female is well rounded transfer the pair to the breeding tank in the late afternoon hours. The spawning will occur in the following morning or the next day; if no spawning behavior is shown after three days, conditioning of the pair should be restarted. Spawning behavior: The male will swim around in a quick manner locking his fins when near the female. During the spawning act both fish roll over, when the female is in the upside down position she ejects the eggs while the male fertilises them. Usually 120-150 eggs are dropped on plants and on to the bottom. When the pair is done, they will start grazing for the eggs and should be removed. Raising the fry: The eggs are light sensitive, so the breeding tank should be as dark as possible. Some believe light contributes greatly to the eggs succumbing to fungal infections, though this may have more to do with cleanliness of tank and water conditions. Methylene blue may be added to the water column to prevent fungi as well. The fry will hatch in 20 to 25 hours, looking like small slivers of glass. Fry can be fed with infusoria, paramecium culture, crushed flakes, and rotifers after they have used all the yolk sack. On the fourth day a very small portion of newly hatched brine shrimp should be introduced. The young consume relatively large live foods such as nauplii of brine shrimp. Later microworms can be added to the diet. Care of the breeding tank: Bottom sediment should always be removed and regular water changes done during the rearing period in order to avoid an accumulation of ammonium and nitrates which can be toxic to the fry. Although large quantities of fry will incubate in waters of low hardness, most of the fry may soon contract non-infectious, constitutional dropsy, and die within a short time. Those which survive will grow well. By the twelfth day, they will show signs of a silver coloring. At three weeks of age, the fry will start showing their characteristic orange line and will be a size of about 1\u00a0cm. By two months they will be about 2\u00a0cm."

Like most other tetras, it feeds primarily on small insects and planktonic animals.[7] Older aquarium books often refer to this species by the junior synonym Pristella riddlei. Aquarists tend to refer to this fish as the golden pristella tetra, though some call it the X-ray tetra, instead. Other common names include goldfinch tetra, a reference to the similarly coloured goldfinch, and pristella tetra, a modification of its Latin name. A common name that was once widespread but is now rarely used is signal tetra, a reference to the similarity between the yellow and black dorsal fin and the arm of a semaphore railway signal. Pristella maxillaris is a small, adaptable fish that is often kept in a home aquarium and will eat most fish foods. It is tolerant of a range of water chemistry values (pH 6\u20138; hardness up to 20 dGH). As a shoaling species, it is usually kept in groups of at least six specimens and away from aggressive or predatory tankmates, but is otherwise easily kept in the community tank.

        "description": " The green neon tetra (Paracheirodon simulans) is a freshwater fish of the family Characidae of order Characiformes. It is native to the upper Orinoco and Negro Rivers in South America.[2] This fish is similar in appearance to the closely related and better-known neon tetra, but it is slightly smaller, and its red patch is less pronounced, while the blue-green areas of the upper body are more brilliant. Also, its body is slimmer than that of the neon tetra. It grows to a maximum overall length of about 3.5\u00a0cm (1.4\u00a0in). Like the other Paracheirodon species, the green neon tetra is kept as an aquarium fish, but it is less commonly seen than either the neon tetra or the cardinal tetra. P. simulans is also sometimes called the blue or false neon. Hyphessobrycon simulans and Cheirodon simulans are obsolete synonyms. This fish loses its brilliant blue and red colors when lights are switched off, but regains them when lights are switched on again. The green neon tetra comes from extremely soft, acidic water at temperatures around 24 to 29\u00a0\u00b0C (75 to 84\u00a0\u00b0F). For breeding, these tetras need water similar to the waters in which they live in the wild; extremely soft water with a pH of about 6 and a temperature of around 77\u00a0\u00b0F (25\u00a0\u00b0C). Ideally, the water should be highly stained by the tannins from peat,[3] in subdued light, shaded by plants. It spawns in a school, although in the actual act of spawning, one female may be closely associated with one or more males. About 130 eggs can be laid by each female. The parents should be removed after spawning. The eggs should hatch in 24 hours. The eggs are light sensitive so avoid light. The babies are very small, so feeding infusoria (protozoa) is necessary early on. As they grow, this can increasingly be supplemented with fine commercial fry foods.

        "description": " Hemigrammus ocellifer is a South American freshwater fish, also described by the synonyms Hemibrycon ocellifer and Tetragonopterus ocellifer.[1] Common names include beacon fish, beacon tetra, head-and-tail light tetra and head-and-taillight tetra.[2][3]  It is found in the rivers of Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, and the Amazon Basin of Brazil and Peru. Most specimens offered for sale in the aquatics trade are tank-raised. It has a maximum size of 5 centimetres (2.0\u00a0in); the sexes are distinguished by mature females being fuller bodied. Captive-raised specimens will acclimatise to a range of water conditions: pH should be 6-8; dH up to 18\u00b0; and temperature 72 to 79\u00a0\u00b0F (22 to 26\u00a0\u00b0C). A suitable species for planted community aquariums, beacon tetras should be kept in shoals of six or more and provided with floating plants to diffuse any bright lighting. Hiding places and open swimming areas should be available and consideration is given to the colors of this fish showing best when they are housed in tanks with a dark substrate and background. Beacon tetras will accept flake, micropellets, and frozen foods such as mosquito larvae, brine shrimp and daphnia. An egg-laying species, Hemigrammus ocellifer is relatively easy to breed. A separate small planted breeding aquarium should be set up with soft, slightly acidic water, and the temperature set at the high end of their range. When morning sunlight hits the tank, spawning should commence, and between 200 and 1000 eggs can be laid. The parents should be removed immediately after spawning ceases, and the eggs will hatch in 24 hours."

        "description": " The lemon tetra (Hyphessobrycon pulchripinnis) is a species of tropical freshwater fish which originates from South America, belonging to the family Characidae. It is a small tetra growing to 5\u00a0cm (2\u00a0in) in length. The species is a long established favourite aquarium fish, being introduced to the aquarium in 1932. The lemon tetra is one of the deeper-bodied tetras, contrasting with slender, torpedo-shaped relations such as the cardinal tetra and the rummy nosed tetra, whose approximate body shape when seen from the side is that of a lozenge,(often referred to as a diamond, is a form of rhombus). The basic body color of an adult specimen is a translucent yellow, with a pearlescent lustre emanating from the scales in particularly fine specimens. The dorsal and anal fin of the fish are marked with black and yellow: specifically, the anal fin is hyaline (glass-like appearance), with a black outer margin, the anterior three or four rays being an intense, acrylic lemon-yellow in hue, while the dorsal fin is principally black with a yellow central patch. The tail fin is mostly hyaline but in fine specimens (particularly alpha males) acquires a gunmetal-blue lustre. The pectoral fins are hyaline whilst the pelvic fins are translucent yellow, becoming more solidly and opaquely yellow with black posterior edges in fine specimens (again, alpha males are particularly notable in this regard). The eye is a notable feature of this fish, the upper half of the iris being an intense red, in some specimens almost gemstone-ruby in appearance. The colour of this part of the iris is an indicator of the health of the fish: if this red colouration fades, or worse still turns grey, then this is an indicator of serious disease in the fish. In common with many characins, the lemon tetra possesses an adipose fin. This fin may acquire a black border, particularly in males, though this is not a reliable characteristic. Black areas of colouration on adult fishes frequently acquire a glossy sheen, enhancing the beauty of the fish. Determining the gender of the fish is achieved in adult specimens by examining the black outer border of the anal fin. In female specimens, this consists of a fine black line, appearing almost as if drawn onto the fin with a fine pencil. In male specimens, particularly alpha males, the border is conspicuously wider, and in breeding alpha males, can cover up to a third of the total area of the anal fin. This is the only reliable means of differentiating gender in this species - while males frequently have taller and more pointed dorsal fins, some females also possess tall, pointed dorsal fins, and thus this characteristic is not reliable. Ripe females are fuller bodied, particularly when viewed from directly above, as the body cavity expands to accommodate the eggs forming within the female's reproductive tract. Juvenile fishes are usually translucent with only a hint of the colour of the adult. Additionally, the gender characteristics in juvenile fishes are not fully formed, so differentiating juveniles into male and female individuals is extremely difficult. The lemon tetra is an Amazon River fish species, first collected from the basin of the Rio Tapajos, near to Santar\u00e9m, Brazil. The fish can be found in both the Rio Tapajos and stretches of the Amazon proper in this region (the Rio Tapajos joins the Amazon at Santar\u00e9m). The lemon tetra inhabits clear waters with a modest to moderate current flow, remaining in shallower waters in close proximity to stands of aquatic plants. The water chemistry is slightly acidic, and the waters are relatively mineral-deficient. Lemon tetras congregate in their chosen waters in large shoals, numbering several thousand individuals, where the black and yellow colouration becomes disruptive from the standpoint of predatory fish species attempting to track an individual fish. The fishes are capable of moving at speed when required, and in a shoal the fishes will, when danger threatens, weave in and out of each other, adding to the visual confusion for a predator. The species preferentially occupies the middle and mid-lower water levels in the wild. Lemon tetras fare best in a planted aquarium, where they should be kept as schooling fishes, allowing them to replicate their wild behaviour as closely as possible. A minimum of six individuals should be kept in an aquarium, though if space allows, a larger number is preferable, as the species exhibits a marked preference for grouping together in large shoals of its own kind where possible. In a planted aquarium, the Lemon Tetra displays more vivid colouration - juvenile specimens in bare dealer aquaria usually appear 'washed out' in appearance and do not show the full splendour of which this species is capable. The aquarium for this species should be furnished with plant thickets interspersed with open swimming areas where the fishes can display to each other. Suitable companions in an aquarium include other tetra species, small barbs, small danios, small rasboras, Corydoras and Otocinclus catfishes, and in aquaria where space allows, certain species of dwarf cichlid such as the smaller Apistogramma species. Tankmates should be chosen to be peaceful, not too large, and a more natural display results if the companion fishes chosen are other South American species. An aquarium containing large shoals of lemon and cardinal tetras makes a particularly stunning display, the blue and red of the Cardinals contrasting with the brilliant yellow and black of the lemons. While the preference of the lemon tetra with respect to water chemistry lies within the realm of soft (hardness less than 8\u00b0 dH) and acidic (pH around 6.6) parameters, the species is notably hardy, and will accommodate itself to a wide range of conditions, the pH range for the fish being from 6.0 to 7.4. Temperature range for the species is 21 to 28\u00a0\u00b0C (70 to 82\u00a0\u00b0F), though the species is capable of withstanding water temperatures up to 32\u00a0\u00b0C (90\u00a0\u00b0F) for considerable periods of time if the water is well oxygenated. Aeration and good quality filtration should be provided for this fish (and indeed for all aquarium fishes) though the fish is sufficiently hardy to cope with aquarium equipment failures provided these are attended to upon discovery. Extremes of high pH (8.0 or higher) and hardness should be avoided, as these will subject the Lemon Tetra to potentially life-threatening stress. Feeding the lemon tetra poses few problems for the aquarist, as the fish readily and eagerly devours all fish foods offered to it. For prime conditioning (especially if captive reproduction is to be attempted) live foods such as Daphnia should be offered. The lemon tetra is particularly fond of live bloodworms (these are the aquatic larvae of Chironomus midges) and will attack this particular food item with a relish that has to be witnessed to be fully appreciated! Prepared foods such as flakes, freeze dried Tubifex worms and similar fare are also devoured avidly. The lifespan of the lemon tetra in the aquarium can be as much as 8 years, though 6 years is a more typical figure. Lemon tetras exhibit an interesting behaviour pattern in the aquarium, replicated by several other characin species, in which males will adopt 'landmarks' within the aquarium and use these as places from which to display as maturity approaches. Displays are principally performed between rival males, which position themselves in a slightly head-up posture, unpaired fins held erect to appear as large and as imposing as possible, and swim forwards with 'flicking' movements of the body. If two rival males approach closely, they will then begin to make passes at each other, which to the causal observer look like attacks: this is an entirely ritualised behaviour, best referred to as 'jousting', where the males make darting movements toward each other but pull away at the last moment. No damage is incurred by either contestant in these events, and evenly matched males that are at a similar level in the social hierarchy will continue such behaviour for 30 minutes or more at a time. This behaviour serves not only to establish the social rankings of the males, but also serves as an indicator of reproductive fitness to the watching females. In the wild, the lemon tetra is a communally spawning fish. Tens of thousands of pairs will spawn together, and choose thickets of fine-leaved aquatic plants as the repository for their fertilised eggs. This behaviour has several ramifications for captive reproduction, as will be duly noted. When ripe females are receptive, males will court them, after a chase sequence through aquatic foliage in which several males may pursue an individual female, breaking off to pursue a different female as the opportunity arises, resulting in the aquarium in mad dashes hither and thither. Eventually, close observation will see a male court a female in some secluded area of aquatic foliage. The courting gesture of the male consists of a quivering motion, with a head-down posture, and the 'flicking' of the unpaired fins in such a manner as to generate flashes of yellow colouration in the visual field of the female. These flashes will be readily visible to the observing aquarist. If the female is ready to spawn, then the pair will migrate to fine-leaved aquatic plants such as Cabomba or Java Moss, whereupon the pair will adopt a side-by-side position. The release of eggs and sperm is signalled by a quivering motion upon the part of both fishes, followed by an 'explosive' parting of the couple accompanied by the appearance of a cloud of eggs. The eggs are non-adhesive, and fall through the foliage, coming to rest either in thicker foliage at the base of the plants, or on the substrate. One of the problems presented to the aquarist by this species is that of egg-eating.[2] In the wild, as has already been noted, tens of thousands of pairs spawn simultaneously, and in order to reduce the competition for their own offspring, a pair will turn around and eat some of the eggs being produced by neighbouring spawning pairs. The same instinct, needless to say, manifests itself in the aquarium, but in an aquarium setting, the only eggs present are usually those of the single spawning pair. Consequently, some of the pair's own eggs will be devoured. Special measures to reduce losses through this behaviour are therefore required if the aquarist is interested in obtaining as large a yield of fry as possible. Special 'egg traps' have been devised for the purpose - these may consist of evenly spaced glass rods in a frame, a layer of glass marbles on the aquarium bottom, or some other such device. The purpose of all these designs is the same - to allow eggs to fall through small gaps into a space where they will be beyond the reach of the adults, who are unable to pass through the same gaps. However, the speed of movement of the adult fishes is such that even with an 'egg trap' in place, a small percentage of eggs will still be eaten. A large adult female in prime condition may produce as many as 300 eggs. A breeding aquarium for the lemon tetra thus requires good quality filtration and aeration, fine leaved plants, and an 'egg trap' present to prevent large-scale losses because of the aforementioned parental instincts. Temperature should be slowly raised over a period of a few days to 28\u00a0\u00b0C, the pair conditioned with copious quantities of live foods if possible, and the aquarium should be sited so as to receive illumination by morning sunshine, as this is a well-documented spawning stimulus for the lemon tetra. Parent fishes should be removed from the breeding aquarium and returned to the main aquarium once spawning is complete. Sometimes, best results are obtained by using two males with one female. Fertile lemon tetra eggs take approximately 72 hours to hatch at 28\u00a0\u00b0C (82\u00a0\u00b0F). The fry spend a further 24 to 48 hours absorbing the yolk sac, whereupon they become free-swimming. At this stage, the fry should be fed with infusoria or a special egglayer fry food, and frequent partial water changes (around 10% of the aquarium volume every 24 to 48 hours) initiated. After 7 days, the fry should be ready to feed upon newly hatched Brine Shrimp. The fry appear to be almost transparent at first, with the exception of the eyes, and do not begin to develop the 'lozenge' shape of the adult body until the differentiation of the finfold into the unpaired fins is complete (around 4\u20136 weeks). Once this process is complete, the fishes are ready to take sifted Daphnia. Maintenance temperature for the fry should be carefully and slowly reduced to around 25\u00a0\u00b0C (77\u00a0\u00b0F) once the fishes are thus recognisably miniature versions of the adults. The first signs of black colouration on the unpaired fins may take a further two weeks of more to being manifesting themselves, and it will not be until the fishes are at least 12 weeks old that they will fully represent miniature versions of the parents. Even at this stage, the black colouration of the unpaired fins will be incompletely developed, and it will not be until sexual maturity is achieved (approximately 8 to 9 months after hatching) that the black border on the anal fin will become a reliable gender differentiation characteristic. When it comes to health and disease concerns Lemon Tetra (Hyphessobrycon pulchripinnis) are relatively hardy but are not immune to common freshwater fish ailments. They are susceptible to diseases such as Ichthyophthirius multifiliis (Ich), which presents as white spots on the skin and fins, and various fungal infections that may manifest as cotton-like growths. Preventative measures include maintaining optimal water quality with regular water changes, ensuring a balanced diet, and avoiding overcrowded conditions that can stress fish and make them more prone to illness. It is also crucial to quarantine new fish before introducing them to an established tank to prevent the spread of disease. With proper care and attention to water quality and nutrition, Lemon Tetras can live a healthy life, contributing to the dynamic ecosystem of a home aquarium.[3]"

        "description": " Hyphessobrycon innesi Myers, 1936 The neon tetra (Paracheirodon innesi) is a Freshwater fish of the characin family (family Characidae) of order Characiformes. The type species of its genus, it is native to blackwater and clearwater streams in the Amazon basin of South America.[2][3] Its bright colouring makes the fish visible to conspecifics in the dark blackwater streams,[4] and is also the main reason for its popularity among freshwater fish hobbyists, with neon tetras being one of the most widely kept tropical fish in the world.[5] The neon tetra is found in the western and northern Amazon basin in southeastern Colombia, eastern Peru, and western Brazil.[2][3] It lives in waters with a temperature between 20 and 28\u00a0\u00b0C (68\u201382\u00a0\u00b0F) and pH 4\u20137.5.[2][3] It has a preference for acidic blackwater streams, but also occurs in transparent clearwater streams.[3] It is not found in the whitewater rivers.[3] UN FAO considers P. innesi an introduced species in Singapore[6] and the United States.[7] FAO considers its introduction to Singapore to be ecologically and socioeconomically beneficial, but it is not established there.[6] The neon tetra has a light-blue back over a silver-white abdomen. The fish is characterized by an iridescent blue horizontal stripe along each side of the fish from its nose to the base of the adipose fin, and an iridescent red stripe that begins at the middle of the body and extends posteriorly to the base of the caudal fin. The fish is partially transparent (including fins) except for these markings. Sexual dimorphism is slight, with the female having a slightly larger belly, and a bent iridescent stripe rather than the male's straight stripe.  During the night, the blue and red become gray or black as the fish rests. It reactivates once it becomes active in the morning.[8] This peculiar change is due to the neon tetras capacity to change the color of its iridescent stripe in response to lighting conditions. In a light-adapted state it is blue-green, likewise in a dark-adapted state its color changes to indigo. This change is produced by guanine crystals in their cells that reflect light. It grows to approximately 4\u00a0cm (1.5\u00a0in) in overall length.[9] The neon tetra was first imported from South America and was described by renowned ichthyologist George S. Myers in 1936, and named after William T. Innes.[10] P. innesi is one of the most popular aquarium fish, with about 2 million sold in the US each month.[11] Most neon tetras available in the United States are imported from Southeast Asia, where they are farm-raised, or to a lesser extent from Colombia, Peru, and Brazil, where they are collected from the wild.[12] During a single month, an average of 1.8 million neon tetras with an estimated value of $175,000 are imported into the United States for the aquarium trade.[13]  With the exception of home aquarists and a few commercial farms that breed neon tetras experimentally, captive breeding on a commercial scale is nonexistent in the USA.[14] In the wild they inhabit very soft, acidic waters (pH 4.0 to 4.8)[15] Ideal pH for aquarium is 7.0, but a range of 6.0 to 8.0 is tolerable.[16] They can have a lifespan of as long as ten years,[17] but normally just two to three years in an aquarium.[18] Neon tetras are considered easy to keep in an aquarium of at least 10 US gallons (38\u00a0L; 8.3\u00a0imp\u00a0gal) with a temperature range of between 72\u201376\u00a0\u00b0F (22\u201324\u00a0\u00b0C), a water pH of between 6.0 and 7.0, GH of below 10 dGH and KH of 1-2 dKH, and under 20 ppm of nitrate.[19] They are shoaling fish and must be kept in groups of at least six, but will be more active in groups of eight to 12 or more.[20] Neon tetras are best kept in a densely planted tank to resemble their native Amazon environments. Neon tetras are omnivores and will accept most flake foods, if sufficiently small, but should also have some small foods such as brine shrimp, daphnia, freeze-dried bloodworms, tubifex, which can be stuck to the side of the aquarium, and micropellet food to supplement their diets. A tropical sinking pellet is ideal, as most brands of these include natural color enhancers that bring out the color in neon tetras. Some frozen foods, including frozen blood worms, add variety to their diets.[21] The male is slender, and the blue line is straighter. The female is rounder, producing a bent blue line. Some aquarists say the females look plumper when viewed from above. However, the straightness of the line and the plumpness of the female might occasionally be due to the eggs she is carrying. A neon tetra can appear slightly plump in the belly due to having overeaten. Neon tetras need dim lighting, a DH less than one, about 5.5 pH, and a temperature of 75\u00a0\u00b0F (24\u00a0\u00b0C) to breed. There also needs to be a lot of tannins in the water. Neon tetras are old enough to breed at 12 weeks.[22] Breeding neon tetras is considered to be difficult in home aquariums.[23] However, it is becoming more common, with less than 5% of specimens currently sold in America caught in the wild, and more than 1.5 million specimens imported to America each month from fish farms.[24] Neon tetras are occasionally afflicted by the so-called \"neon tetra disease\" (NTD) or pleistophora disease, a sporozoan disease caused by Pleistophora hyphessobryconis. Despite being a well-known condition, it is generally incurable and often fatal to the fish. However this disease is also generally preventable.[25] The disease cycle begins when microsporidian parasite spores enter the fish after it consumes infected material, such as the bodies of a dead fish, or live food such as tubifex, which may serve as intermediate hosts. The disease is most likely passed by newly acquired fish that have not been quarantined. Symptoms include restlessness, loss of coloration, lumps on the body as cysts develop, difficulty swimming, curved spines as the disease progresses, and secondary infections, such as fin rot and bloating.[26] A so-called \"false neon disease\", which is bacterial, shows very similar symptoms. It is impossible for the home aquarist to determine for certain the difference between NTD and false NTD on the basis of visible symptoms alone, without laboratory backup. This disease has also been confused with columnaris (mouth rot, mouth fungus, 'flex'). Generally the best 'treatment' is the immediate removal of diseased fish to preserve the remaining fish, although some occasional successful treatments have been performed that include fish baths and a \"medication cocktail\". The use of a diatom filter, which can reduce the number of free parasites in the water, may help. As with Pleistophora neon tetra disease, prevention is most important and this disease is rare when good preventive measures are performed.[25] The green neon tetra (P. simulans) and black neon tetra (Hyphessobrycon herbertaxelrodi) are distinct species\u2014the latter belongs to a different genus\u2014and not color varieties. The cardinal tetra (P. axelrodi) is also a similar species, but its greater extent of red coloring distinguishes it from the neon tetra.[27] The name Hyphessobrycon innesi is an obsolete synonym for P. innesi."

The species was previously misidentified as Thayeria sanctaemariae[6] and Thayeria obliqua. T. obliqua is a superficially similar, but different species of Thayeria, while T. sanctaemariae, is a synonym of T. obliqua.[2] The species feeds on worms, small insects, flake food and crustaceans.[2] In captivity, this normally schooling species forms pairs that scatter their many adhesive eggs amongst plants. Clutch size is very large and may be up to 1000 eggs,  the embryos of which are black in colour[6][7] The eggs hatch in about 20 hours and are free-swimming after 4 days.[4] The species is best kept in groups, to allow the species to school, in tropical freshwater community aquaria with other peaceful, non-predatory fishes.[4][7][8] This fish tolerates a fairly broad range of water pHs, but prefers acidic water for breeding.[8]  This Characidae-related article is a stub.

        "description": " The redeye tetra (Moenkhausia sanctaefilomenae), is a species of tetra from the S\u00e3o Francisco, upper Paran\u00e1, Paraguay and Uruguay river basins in eastern and central South America.[2][3] This freshwater fish is commonly kept in aquariums and bred in large numbers at commercial facilities in Eastern Europe and Asia.[4] The redeye tetra is one of the more popular aquarium fish due to their schooling capability. It can grow up to 7\u00a0cm (2.8\u00a0in) in length,[4] and live for approximately 5 years.[3]  The red-eye tetra has a bright silver body accented by a white-edged black basal half of the tail and a thin red circle around its eye. It is part of a group that consists of three similar species, the two others being M. forestii (upper Paraguay and upper Paran\u00e1 basins) and M. oligolepis (Amazon and Paraguay basins, and the Guianas).[5] Yellow-banded tetra is another common name for the M. sanctaefilomenae. The fish has a yellow band on its caudal peduncle, which differentiates it from the glass tetra.[6] Because of the redeye tetra's hardiness and ease of care, it is considered by aquarists to be an excellent beginner fish. It is readily available, peaceful, and is suitable for most community aquariums,[4] although it is quite active and may disturb slower, more timid species. The redeye tetra is a schooling fish.[6] For this reason aquarists often keep it in groups of six or more.[2] Although generally peaceful, some redeye tetras have been known to be fin nippers on rare occasions, even when kept in groups. If kept alone it is more likely to nip the fins of other fish.[7] A fish tank with volume of about 110 litres (29 US G.) is commonly used. The species is frequently kept at temperatures of 23\u201328\u00b0C (73\u201382\u00b0F) in hard water (100\u2013150 mg/L) with neutral pH (7.0), in a tank with plants around the sides and to the rear and a clear area in the front.[6] Redeyes are reported to be adaptable to a range of water conditions.[6] In the wild the redeye tetra feeds on worms, insects, crustaceans and plant matter.[2] In the aquarium, redeye tetras generally eat all kinds of live, fresh, and flake foods. It can be fed both prepared foods and live foods in captivity.[6] Females are larger and have a more rounded abdomen than the males.[4] When attempting to breed them, a separate breeding tank with slightly acidic, very soft water (4 dGH or below) is often used,[4] with the tank densely planted.[6] The redeye tetra is free spawning, but will also lay eggs among the roots of floating plants.[4] Once spawning has occurred, the mating pair are typically removed, as they will consume the eggs and hatchling fry.[4] The eggs typically hatch one day after they are laid. Aquarists initially feed the fry with infusoria, rotifers, or commercially prepared fry foods, then freshly hatched brine shrimp, and eventually finely crushed flake foods.[4]"

It is the sole member of its genus.[2] The fish was named in honor of Warwick Estevam Kerr (1922-2018), a Brazilian agricultural engineer, geneticist, entomologist, and director of INPA the acronym for Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amaz\u00f4nia, whose field station in N\u00facleo Aripuan\u00e3, Mato Grosso, Brazil, is near the area where the type was found.[3] Inpaichthys kerri was discovered in sunny and moving waters of the forested Queimada river system, a tributary of the Aripuan\u00e3 River. In its natural habitat it lives in very soft and slightly acidic waters with a pH between 6.0 and 6.8.[2] I. kerri is a very active and bold species and has been found schooling with another undescribed species (similar to Hyphessobrycon cachimbensis), and is generally less abundant than the latter, in the ratio 1/200 or less, although it can be quite abundant in some spots.[2] It feeds mainly on insects that fell on the water surface.[2] It is kept as an aquarium fish where it is sold under the additional common names blue emperor tetra, purple emperor tetra, black emperor tetra, or regal tetra[4] (not to be confused with Nematobrycon palmeri with similar appearance and common names). I. kerri requires similar-sized schooling fish that are not overly aggressive, as this species is prone to diseases when stressed in captivity.[5]"

        "description": " Hemigrammus rhodostomus The rummy-nose tetra (Petitella rhodostoma) is a species of tropical freshwater characin fish originating in South America, popular among fishkeepers as a tropical aquarium fish.[2] One of many small tetras belonging to the same genus, it is on average 5\u00a0cm (2\u00a0in) long when fully grown.[3] The fish is one of several very similar species including Petitella bleheri, and Petitella georgiae, and it is possible that more recently collected specimens available in the aquarium trade are members of one or other of these similar species.[4] The common name applied to most of these fishes is \"rummy-nose tetra\", though other common names are in circulation (such as \"firehead tetra\" for P. bleheri, and \u201cfalse rummy nose tetra\u201d for P. georgiae according to FishBase, and Fishkeeping World).[5][6] The rummy-nose tetra is fusiform in shape, whose basal body colour is a translucent silvery colour suffused in some specimens with a greenish tint: iridescent green scales are frequently seen adorning the fish at the point where the fontanel meets the body. The fins are hyaline, with the exception of the caudal fin. This fin being adorned with black and white horizontal stripes, variable in number, but usually comprising one central black stripe in the central portion of the tail fin, with two horizontal black stripes upon each caudal fin lobe, the spaces between the stripes being white, the total count of black stripes being five, or occasionally three; however, whether these features are reliable determinants of species identity has yet to be fully ascertained.[7] The head is a deep red colour, iridescent in lustre, with the red continuing into the iris of the eye, and some red colouration extends beyond the operculum into the anterior-most section of the body proper.[4] Male and female individuals exhibit no obvious visual differences, other than increased fullness of the body outline in ripe females.[8] The three different species of fish known as rummy-nose tetras have the following distributions: All three species of rummy-nose tetra inhabit river stretches whose water chemistry is mineral-deficient (soft), acidic, and frequently tainted with humic acid decay products from leaf litter upon the river substrates (known as 'blackwaters' because of their appearance). Aquatic plants are sometimes present in these stretches of water, though the upper reaches of the Rio Negro are less densely populated with aquatic flora than the other rivers due to shading from the rainforest canopy. The fishes preferentially inhabit the middle and mid-lower water regions.[9] The fish prefer darker waters as evidence of the eggs and fry being light sensitive.[10] The Rummy-nose tetra is a schooling fish which means that the members of each school travel in groups that vary about 6 at minimum to sometimes more than 32 fish. Rummy-nose tetras are also very good at navigating in an environment that is too \"noisy\" for other fish. In a study about the schooling tendencies, Puckett, Pokhrel, and Giannini wrote that the Tetras were able to outperform another schooling species of fish called \"golden shiners\". (Notemigonus crysoleucas). Rummy-nose tetras when schooling tend to rely more on what the individual organism perceives rather than what the group behavior is, which differs from golden shiners (Notemigonus crysoleucas), another type of schooling fish. This can be attributed to the fact that Petitella bleheri is more attuned to the light gradients that are present in its environment. Rummy-nose tetra while being able to perceive their environment better individually rather than in a group still has the ability to sense what the distance is between them and the nears member of the school, thus decreasing the risk of predation.[11] Interestingly, although each species is from different parts of South America, when introduced to either of the other two species, all species will shoal together.[10] The details of aquarium maintenance for all three species are more or less identical: the rummy-nose tetra is a schooling fish, which exhibits tight schooling behaviour both in the wild and in the aquarium. Consequently, these fishes should be maintained in groups of no fewer than six individuals, with larger numbers being preferable where space permits-these tetras preferring about a 25 gallon/80 litre aquarium.[6] All three species are lovers of warm aquarium water, the temperature range for maintenance being 24 to 31\u00a0\u00b0C (75 to 88\u00a0\u00b0F), with the fishes sometimes requiring temperatures as high as 33\u00a0\u00b0C (91\u00a0\u00b0F) for breeding. Consequently, compatibility of these fishes with cooler water fishes is contra-indicated: for example, panda corydoras would be a bad choice of companion as these fishes prefer lower temperatures, and there is little overlap in the temperature ranges of the two species. Many fish can be kept with rummy-nose tetras, some including smaller gourami, other tetras, barbs, danios, Australian rainbows, and various catfish, such as Ancistrus. The rummy-nose tetra cannot be kept with other popular ornamental fishes, such as African cichlids, as they require very different water parameters.[12] The water chemistry preferred by these fishes, as might be inferred readily from that of the wild habitat, is soft, acidic water (hardness no higher than 6\u00b0 dH and pH around 6.4\u20137.0 is preferred). However, for maintenance purposes the pH of the aquarium water can range from 5.6 to 7.4. However, if captive reproduction is to be attempted, the rummy-nose tetra needs soft, acidic water. A planted aquarium is welcomed by these fishes, particularly if the plants include fine-leaved species such as Cabomba and Myriophyllum. Feeding presents relatively few problems, as the fishes will eagerly devour a range of prepared as well as live fish foods. However, if they have a flake or pellet-based diet, a treat once or twice a week is recommended to give the diet variety.[6][13] In common with numerous other tetras, these fishes are particularly fond of live bloodworms (these are the aquatic larvae of a midge belonging to the genus Chironomus) and will also devour live Daphnia avidly. Unlike those tetra species which adapt to surface feeding in the aquarium, rummy-nose tetras are not considered likely to add live mosquito larvae to their diet in the aquarium, though instances where these fishes discover and enjoy this food are possible: usually, rummy-nose tetras prefer to take their foods in the middle and lower regions of the aquarium. Lifespan for the rummy-nose tetra in the aquarium is usually 5 to 6 years with careful maintenance. Exceptional specimens can live for more than 8 years. The fish is interesting in that it can act as a \"mine canary\" in an aquarium, alerting the aquarist to potential pollution problems in an aquarium. When levels of certain metabolic wastes (ammonia, nitrites and nitrates) exceed critical levels, the intense ruby-red colour of the fish's facial area becomes pale. The fishes also become pale in appearance immediately after the disturbance that takes place in the aquarium following a water change, but in this instance, once clean water has been supplied, the intense deep red colour returns. Persistent paleness of the head is to be taken as a sign that water chemistry parameters in the maintenance aquarium are in need of adjustment, and that pollutant levels are becoming dangerous for the inhabitants. Rummy-nose tetras present serious challenges even to experienced aquarists from the standpoint of breeding, primarily due to two factors: the likelihood of sterility ensuing if the prospective parents are maintained in water with too high a level of dissolved calcium ions, and the slow growth rate of the fry. An additional problem is that gender differentiation is difficult by visual inspection alone, making pair selection partly a matter of luck unless an obviously gravid female is available for selection. Again, identical remarks apply to all three species listed above. The breeding aquarium for the rummy-nose tetra, in addition, needs to be sterilised prior to use, as the fish produces eggs that are notoriously sensitive to bacterial and fungal infection. Use of an antifungal agent is strongly advised once spawning is completed in order to prevent various fungi from attacking the eggs. Needless to say, given the above remarks about likely sterility if the fishes are maintained in water whose chemical parameters are incorrect, prospective parents must be maintained in soft, acidic water throughout their lives if they are to remain capable of reproduction. Failure to do so will destroy any chances of success from the very start. Furthermore, it is highly advisable to filter the water of the breeding aquarium over peat, or alternatively use one of the commercially available 'Blackwater Tonic' additives to provide the necessary chemical environment conducive to reproduction. Parent fishes should, in addition, be conditioned heavily with copious live foods to bring them into prime breeding condition. Though the fishes prefer to spawn among fine leaved plants, one problem that the aquarist faces in this regard is that the majority of fine leaved plants available in the aquarium prefer high light levels (Cabomba is a particular case in point) while the rummy-nose tetra prefers to spawn under subdued lighting conditions. Workarounds for this include the use of Java moss (a plant that thrives even in very low light levels, and is an ideal spawning medium for many fishes) or the use of synthetic alternatives (\"spawning mops\" made of nylon are typically deployed where a suitable natural plant is unavailable). The parents should be introduced to the breeding aquarium up to 7 days before spawning, fed heavily with live foods, and kept under subdued lighting. In addition, the parents tend to prefer to spawn under quiet conditions, and thus the aquarium should be sited away from areas of busy human traffic. The temperature should be slowly raised to 32\u00a0\u00b0C (90\u00a0\u00b0F), and sometimes 33\u00a0\u00b0C (91\u00a0\u00b0F) may be needed depending upon the individual specimens. Spawning is difficult to observe, taking place as it does under subdued lighting, and while chase sequences followed by the adoption of a side-by-side position by the parents amid the provided spawning media may be taken as indication that spawning is indeed taking place, this is by no means certain. The judicious use of a low-power flashlight to observe spawning may be helpful in determining if eggs are actually being produced. The species is not noted as a particularly egregious egg eater (unlike, for example, the lemon tetra) but it is still advisable to remove the parents once spawning is completed. At this stage, antifungal agents to protect the eggs should be added, and indeed are vital in the case of this difficult, sensitive species. Once spawning is completed, it is advisable to keep the aquarium under dim lighting conditions until the eggs have hatched and the fry are free-swimming. While rummy-nose tetras do not need their eggs to be kept in total darkness as is the case for neon and cardinal tetras, the eggs are known to exhibit some degree of photosensitivity, and subdued lighting is highly advisable during egg development in the breeding aquarium. Fertile rummy-nose tetra eggs take approximately 72 to 96 hours to hatch at 32\u00a0\u00b0C (90\u00a0\u00b0F). The fry spend a further 24 to 48 hours absorbing the yolk sac, whereupon they become free-swimming. At this stage, the fry should be fed with infusoria or a special egglayer fry food, and frequent partial water changes (around 10% of the aquarium volume every 24 to 48 hours) initiated. Having overcome the challenge of persuading the fishes to spawn, the aquarist soon discovers that the rummy-nose tetra presents another hurdle to successful captive reproduction\u2014the fry are among the slowest growing of all characins, and indeed among the slowest-growing of all popular aquarium fishes. Infusoria and other similar foods are required for the fry for a minimum of three weeks, and it is not unknown for the fishes to take as long as twelve weeks to migrate to larger foods, growth rates being particularly sensitive to temperature. Success at raising fry to a size where they are capable of taking larger food morsels is much more likely to be achieved if the fry are kept at temperatures above 30\u00a0\u00b0C for the first 3 months of life: even then, attrition rates due to the appearance of diseases among the fishes (most frequently bacterial infections) can be severe. It can take as long as 6 months to raise fry to juvenile sizes where they are capable of eating live daphnia on a regular basis. During this time, they are likely to be sensitive to sudden changes in water chemistry, and managing pollutants in the fry aquarium is made all the more difficult by the need to maintain low mineral content in the aquarium water during development in order to prevent sterility affecting the fishes\u2014the buffering capacity of the aquarium is likely to be low as a result of the low concentration of bicarbonate ions that is needed in addition to the low concentration of calcium ions. Taking all of these factors into account, the fish is a major breeding challenge for the aquarist, and success may depend at least partly upon luck."

        "description": " Copella arnoldi, commonly known as the splash tetra or the splashing tetra, is a species of tropical freshwater fish belonging to the family Lebiasinidae.[1][2] It is native to South America. The fish is named in honor of German aquarist Johann Paul Arnold (1869-1952), who collected the type specimen.[3] The splash tetra is a small, slender fish with a standard length of 3 to 4\u00a0cm (1.2 to 1.6\u00a0in). The mouth is relatively large and upturned, with acutely pointed teeth; this contrasts with the more horizontal mouth of the rather similar pencil fishes (Nannostomus). The maxillary bones are curved in an S-shape and the nostrils are separated by a ridge of skin. There is a dark spot on the dorsal fin and a dark line from the snout to the eye, which may continue to the operculum. There is no lateral line and no adipose fin.[2] The species is endemic to tropical river basins in South America where it is present in river systems from the Orinoco to the Amazon River. It is found in shallow streams, both in clearwater forest creeks and in blackwater creeks in swamps and wetlands.[2] Worms, crustaceans and other invertebrates, particularly small insects that fall onto the surface of the water, make up the splash tetra's diet.[2][1] This fish has an unusual system of reproduction, with the male fish caring for the eggs. During the breeding season, the male chooses a suitable location with overhanging foliage. When he has attracted a female to this spot, the pair simultaneously leap out of the water and cling onto a low-hanging leaf with their pelvic fins for up to ten seconds. Here the female lays a batch of six to ten eggs which are immediately fertilised by the male, before both fish fall back into the water.[2] Further batches are laid in a similar manner until there are 100 to 200 eggs on the leaf and the female is spent. The male remains close at hand, repeatedly splashing water onto the eggs to keep them damp. The rate of splashing is up to about 38 splashes per hour. The eggs hatch after some 36 to 72 hours and the fish fry fall into the water below.[2][4][5]"

It is native to the Amazon River drainage in Brazil, Peru, Paraguay, Bolivia and northern Argentina. The fish can be found in slow moving or still backwater including, ponds, small lakes, and streams. In the wild, it forms aggregations around vegetation and tree roots, and thrives when the water temperature is 22\u201327\u00a0\u00b0C (72\u201381\u00a0\u00b0F). Serpae tetra can grow to be 5\u00a0cm (2.0\u00a0in). They have very distinctive coloring with a red body and a black spot near their gills. It is an omnivore and will feed on flake and blood worms. Serpae tetras prefer water temperatures ranging from 72\u201379\u00a0\u00b0F (22\u201326\u00a0\u00b0C). They will generally do better and show off their best colors in soft, neutral to slightly acidic water. As with any other schooling fish, they thrive in large groups and should be kept in schools of at least six fish. The tank should be well-planted, providing shelter and hiding spots. Common to these fish is a 'sputtering' or 'twitching' style of swimming, in which their movements seem more spastic as opposed to other fish.  Instead of swimming smoothly or for long distances at a time, Serpae Tetras move in relatively short spurts, unless stressed.  This is their normal behavior and by itself need not alarm aquarists. If any aggression is seen in the fish, it is usually among conspecifics, especially if they are kept in large groups where they can establish a pecking order (a behavior similar to Puntius tetrazona). Breeding, as with most other tetras, can be difficult due to the few obvious differences between the genders. However, males are usually slimmer and smaller than females. Also, a visible difference in the shape of the swim bladder can be seen above and behind the silverish abdominal cavity. To breed these fish, they should be given a small, dedicated breeding tank planted with thick bunches of fine-leaved plants such as Myriophyllum on which they can lay eggs. Filtering through peat moss can also be helpful. The eggs hatch in about 2 days. The average lifespan for a serpae tetra is about seven years."

The fish thrive in temperatures that range from 72\u201382\u00a0\u00b0F (22\u201328\u00a0\u00b0C). They live in slightly acidic waters that range from a pH of 6.0 - 8.0. They are common to find in pet stores and are relatively easy to care for. They can be affected by parasites and infections. When they are preparing to breed, the male will be brightly colored while the female will be swollen. When they breed, the female scatters their eggs among vegetation while the male fertilizes them. The species have been known to eat their own eggs. The eggs will hatch after 1 and a half days.[3] The genome was fully sequenced in 2013, by standard PCR, and found to be 16,581 base pairs long.[4]"

        "description": " Pristella maxillaris is a species of characin in the genus Pristella, and is commonly known as the X-ray fish or X-ray tetra because of its translucent body.[4] It is a widely distributed and adaptable fish, found in the Amazon and Orinoco basins, as well as coastal rivers in the Guianas in both acidic and alkaline waters.[5] Unlike most other characins, it is tolerant of (and sometimes found in) slightly brackish water.[6] It is small (up to around 5\u00a0cm or 2.0\u00a0in in length) and lives in large groups, and males can be distinguished from females by being smaller and thinner than the females. Like most other tetras, it feeds primarily on small insects and planktonic animals.[7] Older aquarium books often refer to this species by the junior synonym Pristella riddlei. Aquarists tend to refer to this fish as the golden pristella tetra, though some call it the X-ray tetra, instead. Other common names include goldfinch tetra, a reference to the similarly coloured goldfinch, and pristella tetra, a modification of its Latin name. A common name that was once widespread but is now rarely used is signal tetra, a reference to the similarity between the yellow and black dorsal fin and the arm of a semaphore railway signal. Pristella maxillaris is a small, adaptable fish that is often kept in a home aquarium and will eat most fish foods. It is tolerant of a range of water chemistry values (pH 6\u20138; hardness up to 20 dGH). As a shoaling species, it is usually kept in groups of at least six specimens and away from aggressive or predatory tankmates, but is otherwise easily kept in the community tank. The minimum aquarium size is typically 60 x 30\u00a0cm (15 Gallons).[citation needed]"

        "description": " The Congo tetra (Phenacogrammus interruptus) is a species of fish in the African tetra family, found in the central Congo River Basin in Africa. It is commonly kept in aquaria. The Congo tetra has a typical full-bodied tetra shape with rather large scales. When mature, the iridescent colors of the Congo tetra run through the fish from front to back, starting with blue on top changing to red through the middle, to yellow-gold, and back to blue just above the belly. It is not its fluorescent colors that make this tetra so distinct, but rather its tail fin, which develops into a grayish-violet feathery appendage with white edges. The males get up to 3.0\u00a0inches (8.5\u00a0cm). Females up to 2.75\u00a0inches (6\u00a0cm). The male is larger with more color, also the tail fin and dorsal fin are more extended.[2] They also have different colors and extensions in the caudal fin. Congo tetra are a popular aquarium species. However, their large size and active behavior makes them unsuited for most smaller tanks. They easily adapt to captive diets like pellets and frozen foods, though they will still hunt down live foods when offered. They have successfully been bred in captivity and captive bred individuals are commonly available. Whilst they can be kept healthy on a slightly wider range of water parameters, breeding often requires water parameters more similar to their natural habitat. Bad water quality has been known to affect male fin development and lead to loss of coloration.[3] The Congo Tetra is a moderately hardy freshwater fish. This species thrives in a well-maintained aquarium that mimics its natural, slightly acidic and soft-water habitat. Optimal health for Congo Tetras is achieved in a stable environment with good water quality, a balanced pH level of around 6.0 to 7.5, and temperatures between 72\u00b0F and 82\u00b0F. A varied diet, including quality flake food, frozen or live brine shrimp, and bloodworms, is essential for maintaining their vibrant colors and overall vitality. Common diseases affecting Congo Tetras include Ichthyophthirius multifiliis (Ich), a parasitic infection manifesting as white spots on the body and fins, and fin rot, often due to poor water quality. Preventive care is key, emphasizing regular water changes, tank cleanliness, and avoiding overfeeding. Quarantining new fish before introducing them to the main tank is crucial to prevent the spread of diseases. In case of illness, early detection and treatment, often involving specific medications and improved tank conditions, are vital for recovery.[3] Proper care and attention to their environmental needs ensure these stunning fish remain a healthy and dynamic part of any aquarium community. The IUCN lists the Congo tetra as a species of Least Concern."

Originating in South America in the Peruvian and middle Amazon, the Guianas and Venezuela, it grows to about 2.5 inches (6.5\u00a0cm). The fish gets its name from its relatively large protruding belly which resembles a hatchet. Hatchetfish will often jump out of the water when alarmed, propelled by their large, winglike pectoral fins. They also jump to catch small aerial insects. The river hatchetfish is a schooling species best kept in groups of five or more that spends most of its time in the top-level of the water where it searches for food.  These fish are peaceful towards other fishes, but frequently bicker among themselves. Typical lifespan in captivity is around five years, but can live longer. They come from streams in a tropical climate and prefer water at pH 6\u20137, a water hardness of up to 15.0 dGH, and an ideal temperature range of (23-27\u00a0\u00b0C (73-81\u00a0\u00b0F) . As carnivores, they will readily eat many types of small annelid worms, insects, and crustaceans, and they will also eat standard flake foods. They have a reputation for being greedy fish. Because of their natural tendency to jump when alarmed, they may jump out of aquarium tanks. To prevent this, the top must either be completely sealed, or the water level lowered so the edges of the tank extend further upwards than the fish are capable of jumping.  This is also less common with the addition of floating plants, to provide cover.  It is also advised to keep them in a planted aquarium. This Characiformes-related article is a stub.

Hatchet shaped, it presents a gold line extending from its eye to its caudal fin while the area below has a brown and cream colored marble-like pattern (hence its name). The marbled hatchetfish is common in the aquarium industry.  Like most Amazonian fish, the species prefers softer, acidic water. As with most characins, they are omnivores. Hatchets have a tendency to be shy fish and are easily intimidated by larger or fast moving fish, so they are only appropriate for very peaceful communities or species tanks. The marbled hatchetfish is usually kept in small schools. It is necessary for tanks inhabited by these fish to have a tight lid, as they can jump out when startled. Marbled hatchetfish are egg scatterers and have been bred in the aquarium hobby. Marbled hatchetfish are adapted to life in the Amazonian rivers as they resemble a dead leaf floating sideways on the surface of a body of water. This camouflage protects them against potential predators that may be lurking in the water. Their marble-like pattern is to give the illusion of rays of light breaking the waters surface and reflecting on the portrayed leaf. The fish itself does not move much, letting the waves and currents move it mostly, but with occasional brief twitching movements. This replicates the way a leaf would be blown around or carried away by the tide or a current. The line running from its eye, to its tail, is believed to replicate the midrib (midvein) of a leaf."

        "description": " Nannostomus marginatus, (from the Greek: nanos = small, and the Latin stomus = relating to the mouth; from the Latin: marginatus = marginated),[1][2] commonly known as the dwarf pencilfish, is a freshwater species of fish belonging to the genus Nannostomus in the characin family Lebiasinidae.[3] They were first described in 1909 by C. H. Eigenmann and are typical of members of this genus being small, elongated fish with prominent horizontal stripes.  The most notable feature of N. marginatus is its size, it being one of the smallest members of the genus, only reaching a maximum size of 35\u00a0mm. They occur widely on the South American continent having been recorded in Brazil, Guyana, Colombia, Suriname, and Peru, and have been a popular aquarium species since their introduction to aquarists in the early twentieth century. [4] The common name given to  N. marginatus is typically dwarf pencilfish, reflecting its diminutive size, although it is not the smallest known member of the genus since both N. minimus and N. anduzei are smaller possessing a maximum length of only 23mm and 16mm respectively. N. marginatus picturatus, a variant described by Hoedeman in 1954, is now regarded as a junior synonym.  This Characiformes-related article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it."

        "description": " Nannostomus trifasciatus, (from the Greek: nanos = small, and the Latin stomus = relating to the mouth; from the Latin: trifasciatus = three bands),[1][2] commonly known as the three-lined or three-stripe pencilfish, is a freshwater species of fish  belonging to the characin family Lebiasinidae. They are popular in the aquarium trade due to their small size, beautiful color pattern, and relative hardiness. Steindachner first described the species in 1876, making it one of the first four species in the genus to be described. As a result of the broad distribution of N. trifasciatus, the species is polymorphic and, over the years, some of these color morphs have been erroneously described as separate species. Poecilobrycon erythrurus and Poecilobrycon vittatus, two such examples, are now known to be junior synonyms. N. trifasciatus inhabits slow-moving, slightly acidic waters.  Within these conditions, it is found in several different habitat types. It has a broad distribution throughout the Amazon basin, Brazil, Colombia, Peru, northern Bolivia, and the Guianas. In the Rio Negro, it inhabits the large swamps that form where tributaries meet the main branch of the river. When the river floods, it moves into the inundated rainforest. During the low-water season, it often becomes trapped in small lakes that are left behind, or stays close to the wooded edges of the forest. N. trifasciatus rests near the water surface at night and during the day inhabits the middle to upper water layers. The three-lined pencilfish is a small fish, with adults not reaching more than 6\u00a0cm in length. It has a small terminal mouth, and an adipose fin may or may not be present. Most pencilfish  possess distinct daytime and nighttime color patterns, and N. trifasciatus is no exception. During the day, it has three black longitudinal stripes that run the length of the body. At night, three large dark spots materialize on the sides of the fish, extending from its back to its belly. Research has shown that this change in coloration is due to the differential action of the pineal hormone melatonin on pigment cells in different regions of the integument. The daytime color pattern may serve an aposematic or recognition function for individuals of the same species, and the nighttime pattern may help hide the fish from nocturnal predators. In between the variable, darkly pigmented regions, N. trifasciatus is greenish-gold in color on its back and sides and silver underneath. The gill cover and dorsal, pelvic, anal, and caudal fins possess red blotches, varying in size depending on the population. N. trifasciatus has often been confused in aquarium literature with N. marginatus which is also a three-striped pencilfish; however, the latter species can be distinguished by its smaller size and blockier profile. Sexual dimorphism in this species is the least evident of the many species in the genus Nannostomus. The anal fin of males, which is often modified in shape or is more colorful in many Nannostomus species, is not modified or more colorful in N. trifasciatus. Males of the species may have an additional row of red spots in the gold area between the middle and uppermost stripes, but this is extremely variable even within populations. Males are sometimes slimmer and more colorful than females, but once again, this is  variable. N. trifasciatus is omnivorous and spends much of its time near the water surface, where it feeds primarily on insects. It is also an avid biofilm grazer, ingesting microorganisms, as well as algae. N. trifasciatus is a popular and appropriate community aquarium species, if tankmates are of similar size and demeanor, and will thrive if kept in soft, mildly acidic water at temperatures between 72 and 82\u00a0\u00b0F. Baby brine shrimp and other small-sized foods are indicated. Males establish and defend small territories. The species  spawns during the daytime among plant leaves. The eggs are adhesive and are most often placed on plants. Fertilization takes place externally, and 30-100 eggs are produced at a time. The eggs hatch in 24\u201372 hours, depending on the water temperature.  If well-fed, and if sufficient plant cover is provided, breeders will not eat eggs and fry will be found among floating plants. This species is seldom spawned in captivity and has never been commercially raised in fisheries. The aquarium trade relies exclusively on wild-caught specimens."

        "description": " Nannostomus unifasciatus,  (from the Greek: nanos = small, and the Latin stomus = relating to the mouth; from the Latin: unifasciatus = one band),[1][2] commonly known as the one-lined pencilfish, is a freshwater species of fish  belonging to the genus Nannostomus in the characin family Lebiasinidae. They are popular in the aquarium trade due to their small size, beautiful color pattern, unique swimming posture and relative hardiness.[1] With its long, pencil-shaped profile, its single jet black stripe reminiscent of the graphite core of a pencil, and its eraser-colored caudal fin, this is the species for which the popular name, 'pencilfish', was first coined in the 1920s, later to be applied to all the species of the genus Nannostomus.[1][3][4] Steindachner first described the species in 1876, making it the second of what are now nineteen  species in the genus to be described.[5][6] The taxonomy for the entire genus was for many decades the subject of heated debate, resulting in numerous conflicting revisions, leaving the genus for long periods in a state which has been aptly described as 'chaotic.'[7] N. unifasciatus was often at the center of this controversy and this for several reasons.[8] N. unifasciatus, is broadly distributed throughout the Amazon basin, in Brazil, the Guiana Shield, Colombia, Venezuela, and northern Bolivia.[6]  As a result, the species is polychromatic with many geographic populations manifesting subtle differences in color pattern. Over the years, some of these color morphs have been erroneously described as separate species.[8] Further taxonomic confusion arose when various authors erected other genera for Nannostomus unifasciatus and its congeners, Nannostomus eques and Nannostomus harrisoni. Confounding the situation still further, Dutch naturalist, J. J. Hoedeman published a paper in The Amsterdam Naturalist in 1950 that put forth that N. unifasciatus and N. eques were one and the same species.[7] Consensus was finally achieved when, in his seminal paper on the genus Nannostomus  in 1975, Dr. Stanley Howard Weitzman restored Steindachner's taxonomy and expanded upon it, reaffirming the status of N. unifasciatus and N. eques as distinct and individuated species, and placing N. unifasciatus and all of its congeners in one genus, Nannostomus.[8] As a result, 'Poecilobrycon ocellatus,' 'Nannobrycon unifasciatus,' and similar epithets formerly applied to the species, are now relegated to junior synonyms to N. unifasciatus.[8] A population of the species has also been discovered on the island of Trinidad, but it is believed to have been introduced.[6] Nannostomus unifasciatus commonly inhabits slow-moving tributaries, small rivers, and swampy areas throughout its substantial range. Dense aquatic vegetation and/or submerged branches and leaf litter are most often present. They also congregate beneath floating islands.[6] Water parameters invariably range from slightly acidic (pH 6.5) to strongly acidic (pH 4.0) with negligible hardness.[6] Their congener, N. eques, is often found associated with them nearby, along with numerous other species of small characins.[6] Though the one-lined pencilfish is a small fish, with adults not reaching more than 7\u00a0cm in length, it is nevertheless one of the largest species of Nannostomus.[8] It is a long slender species with a small terminal mouth, and an adipose fin.[6]  It has one black longitudinal stripe that runs the length of the body and onto the caudal fin.  The single black stripe is bordered above by a thin metallic gold band. The caudal is colored variously depending on the geographic population.[8] Most all forms have red or orange pigment of varying intensity in the lower quadrant of the caudal, ventral to the black stripe. In some especially colorful populations, the red pigment extends above the black stripe as well, as pictured above.[1] The Guyanese population, as well as one form from Bolivia, manifest a well-defined caudal ocellus above the black stripe.[8] The ventral and anal fins are usually tipped with an enamel blue-white.  N. unifasicatus is one of two species of Nannostomus, the other being Nannostomus eques, that postures itself at an oblique, snout-up angle.  Because of this similarity, N. unifasciatus and N. eques have often been confused in aquarium literature, though they are colored entirely differently from each other.[1] Nannostomus harrisoni, another long, slender single-striped species, is also often confused with N. unifasciatus based on a similar profile and coloration, but N. harrisoni swims in a horizontal posture and possesses bright red adornments on its anal and ventral fins, absent in N. unifasciatus.[5] Sexual dimorphism in this species is typical of many species in the genus Nannostomus. The anal fin of males is modified in shape in most populations, the male's fin being slightly elongated. It is the least evident in the Guyanese population. The white tips of the ventral and anal fins are invariably brighter and more prominent on males. Males are also usually slimmer in profile.[5] Nannostomus unifasciatus is omnivorous and  feeds primarily on insects and small crustaceans. It is also an avid periphyton grazer, ingesting microorganisms as well as algae.[9] Though it has gone through periodic episodes of scarcity in the aquarium trade,[1][4][10] N. unifasciatus has long been considered a most desirable aquarium species, Dr. William T. Innes describing them as possessing \"a marked elegance\" and manifesting \"that indefinable something known as class\" in 1935.[1]  It is an appropriate community aquarium species, if tankmates are of similar size and demeanor, and will thrive if kept in soft, mildly acidic water, low nitrate levels, and at temperatures between 72F and 82F.[3] Baby brine shrimp and other small-sized foods are indicated.[11]  Males will establish and defend small territories. Unlike its congener, N. eques, which prefers the upper strata of the aquarium, N. unifasciatus tends to congregate in the mid to lower reaches.[9] This is the only species of Nannostomus in the aquarium trade for which there is no recorded account of a successful spawning in captivity to date, this despite it being a widely kept and much admired aquarium species since the 1920s.[4][10][11] Two reports of purported successful spawnings in the 1950s, published in aquarium literature\u2014one in the Belgian magazine, \"Notre Aquarium,\" and the other in the American magazine, \"The Aquarium\"\u2014involved misidentification of the species, the spawnings having occurred for N. eques and N. harrisoni respectively, not N. unifasciatus.[9][11][3]"

        "description": " The emerald catfish  (Corydoras splendens) is a tropical freshwater fish belonging to the Corydoradinae sub-family of the family Callichthyidae native to the Amazon Basin in South America.[1] It has traditionally been known as Brochis splendens.[2] The fish has appeared on a stamp in Brazil.[3] It was originally described as Callichthys splendens by Fran\u00e7ois Louis de la Porte, comte de Castelnau in 1855.  This species was once also commonly called Brochis coeruleus. W. A. Gosline was the first to suspect that the two species were the same in 1940, but it was actually Njiseen & Isbr\u00fccker, in 1970, who combined the two, giving sufficient reasons for doing so. The species would be described as Brochis splendens, until most of the catfish formerly classified as Brochis were re-classified into Corydoras.[2] The current recognized classification is thus Corydoras splendens.[1] It is native to the upper reaches Amazon Basin.[1] This includes Ucayali River to Pucallpa, Ambiyacu River, and the area around Iquitos in western Brazil, southeastern Colombia, eastern Ecuador and eastern Peru. Depending upon the angle of lighting, the fish's body reflects a metallic green, blue-green, or even a bluish color.  The ventral area is yellowish with the pectoral, ventral, and anal fins yellowish and the dorsal, caudal, and adipose fins a translucent brownish.  The females are larger and more robust than the males, and have a more pinkish belly as opposed to the more yellowish one for the males. This fish can be distinguished from the green/bronze corydoras catfish by its usually larger size, stouter body, and more pointed snout. The fish inhabits sluggish waters with dense vegetation along the banks.[1] It occurs in shallow muddy waters and will grow in length up to 7.5\u00a0centimetres (3\u00a0in).[1] It lives in a tropical climate in water with a 5.8\u20138.0 pH, a water hardness of 2\u201330 dGH, and a temperature range of 22\u201328\u00a0\u00b0C (72\u201382\u00a0\u00b0F).[1] It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, and insect larvae. It lays eggs in dense vegetation and adults do not guard the eggs. The emerald catfish is a common species in freshwater aquaria.  It is a peaceful, undemanding species and can be maintained under the same conditions as most Corydoras species.  They are shy and easily frightened when kept as individuals, so it is best kept in small groups of at least three, with more being recommended.  The tank should have only a soft, fine bottom to prevent damage to barbels and should be heavily planted.[4] Feeding is not difficult and they accept almost anything, although live worms are especially appreciated.[5] It does well in a community tank and does not tear up the plants.[5] Spawning has been achieved in captivity.[4] Typically, the fish are separated into a breeding tank in the ratio of three males to two females, all well-conditioned on live foods.  The couple will spawn while sitting on the bottom, not while swimming as many similar species do. In captivity, the female collects the eggs in her pelvic fin basket and pastes them individually to plants and other objects.  Eggs will be deposited by the female throughout the tank, but especially on any floating surface plants.  According to most reports, the parents do not immediately try to eat the eggs.  The eggs hatch in about four days and the fry become free swimming two days later."

It is native to South America, and is found in the western Amazon basin in Ecuador and Peru. This species is traditionally placed in Brochis but the genus is a synonym of Corydoras.[1][2] FishBase continues to recognize Brochis as a valid genus.[3] The fish has about 17 dorsal fin rays as compared with the 11 or 12 commonly seen in Corydoras splendens. The snout is considerably longer than other species in the genus which explains the common name. The fish will grow in length up to 6.7 centimetres (2.6 inches).[citation needed] The hog-nosed catfish lives in a tropical climate in water with a 6.0\u20137.2 pH, a water hardness of 15 dGH, and a temperature range of 21\u201324\u00a0\u00b0C (70\u201375\u00a0\u00b0F). It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter.

It originates in coastal drainages in South America from Rio de Janeiro to Santa Catarina, Brazil.[2] It was originally described as Callichthys barbatus by Jean Ren\u00e9 Constant Quoy & Joseph Paul Gaimard in 1824, from which it was transferred to genus Corydoras as Corydoras barbatus, a name which by which it is still being referred to in the aquarium industry. The species was further transferred to genus Scleromystax in 2003.[3] The fish will grow in length up to 9.8\u00a0centimetres (3.9\u00a0in).[2] This species has pronounced sexual dimorphism. The dorsal and pectoral fins of males reach, or almost reach, the caudal peduncle, and well-developed odontodes are inserted in fleshy tissue on a large area on the sides of the snout in fully grown males.[4] The banded corydoras lives in a subtropical climate in water with a 6.0\u20138.0 pH, a water hardness of 2\u201325 dGH, and a temperature of 68\u00a0\u00b0F (20\u00a0\u00b0C) to 82\u00a0\u00b0F (28\u00a0\u00b0C).[2] It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. It lays eggs in dense vegetation and adults do not guard the eggs. In captivity, as the sperm are released the female sinks to the bottom, resting on one of her pectoral fins while she starts fanning with the other pectoral fin. At this time, some eggs are released which fall into the pelvic fin basket and are apparently fertilized at that time. The banded corydoras is of commercial importance in the aquarium trade industry. Though peaceful, they get larger than most Corydoras and are therefore less suitable for small aquaria.[5]  This Callichthyidae-related article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it."

        "description": " The bronze corydoras  (Corydoras aeneus), also known as the green corydoras, bronze catfish, lightspot corydoras or wavy catfish, is a species of freshwater fish in the armored catfish family, Callichthyidae, often kept as an aquarium fish. It is widely distributed in South America on the eastern side of the Andes, from Colombia and Trinidad to the R\u00edo de la Plata basin;[2] however, as presently defined it is a species complex and a taxonomic review is necessary.[3] It was originally described as Hoplosoma aeneum (based on a specimen from Trinidad) by Theodore Gill in 1858 and has historically also been referred to as Callichthys aeneus.[2] The adult size is 6\u00bd cm for males and a slightly larger 7\u00a0cm for females (2\u00bd to 2\u00be inches).[4]   Females have a slightly higher body frame than males in accordance with their larger abdominal region. Their average life span is 10 years. It has a yellow or pink body, white belly, and is blue-grey over its head and back. Its fins are yellow or pink and immaculate. In common with most Corydoras the dorsal, pectoral and adipose fins have an additional sharp barb and have a mild poison which causes fish which try to attack them to get stung. A brownish-orange patch is usually present on the head, just before the dorsal fin, and is its most distinctive feature when viewed from above in the stream. Their upper sides are often a greenish color, which is the reason another common name for this fish is the green corydoras. Like many other catfishes, females are larger than males in this species.[5] They are found in quiet, shallow waters with soft bottoms that can sometimes be heavily polluted by clouds of disturbed mud from the bottom, but it also inhabits running waters.[2] In its native habitat, it inhabits waters with a temperature range of 25\u00a0\u00b0C to 28\u00a0\u00b0C (77\u00a0\u00b0F to 82\u00a0\u00b0F), pH 6.0\u20138.0, and hardness 5 to 19 DGH.[2] Like most members of the genus Corydoras, these catfish have a unique method of coping with the low oxygen content that prevails in such environments. In addition to utilizing their gills like any other fish, they rapidly come to the surface of the water and draw air in through their mouth. This air is then absorbed through the wall of the intestine and any surplus air is expelled through the vent.[2] It typically stays in schools of 20 to 30 individuals.[2] It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter.[2] Reproduction occurs with the onset of the rainy season, which changes the water chemistry.[2] Females spawn 10\u201320 egg-clutches with multiple males at a time, but an entire egg clutch is inseminated by the sperm of a single male.[5] In laboratory observations, it was found that bronze corydoras have a unique method of insemination. When these fish reproduce, the male will present his abdomen to the female. The female will attach her mouth to the male's genital opening, creating the well-known \"T-position\" many Corydoras exhibit during courtship. The female will then drink the sperm. The sperm rapidly moves through her intestines and is discharged together with her eggs into a pouch formed by her pelvic fins. The female can then swim away and deposit the pouch somewhere else alone. Because the T-position is exhibited in other species than just C. aeneus, it is likely that they also exhibit this behavior.[6] In the wild, eggs are laid on waterweeds.[5] Males do not form territories or compete over females; interference between males might only happen when two males present their abdomens simultaneously. On the other hand, females do not choose between males. Mating is more or less random; therefore, male reproductive success is directly related to courtship frequency.[5] The eggs of C. aeneus exhibit a unique surface pattern with small villi-like protuberances which resemble attaching-filaments of teleost eggs. These structures allow the eggs to be adhesive and stick to a specific place or to each other. The presence of these structures may be related to the turbid habitat in which this species lives.[7] Bronze corydoras are probably the most popular Corydoras species.[8] It is annually bred and shipped in large quantities all over the world[9] It is easily bred and is produced in commercial quantities in the United States, Europe, and Singapore. Most of the available fish are therefore domestic strains. Wild imports are reported to be less easy to breed.[citation needed] They are a hardy and useful aquarium fish despite having a coloration that is by no means striking or unusual. Many aquarists are fascinated by the habits of these fish. They ceaselessly comb the bottom of the aquarium for food and therefore disturb it slightly, sending up detritus and waste material that has settled loosely on the bottom. They prefer being kept in groups of 5 or more, being sociable fish and are ideal fish for a community tank.[2] Other Corydoras species can be placed in the same aquarium, and despite the strong resemblance many species bear to one another, the species will tend to separate out and only move about among their own kind. Corydoras aeneus is not particular about the composition of the water. Adequate conditions are a temperature range of 20 to 28\u00a0\u00b0C (68 to 82\u00a0\u00b0F), pH of 6.0\u20138.0, and hardness of 2\u201330 DGH. The water should have no salt added to it.[8] A fairly dense growth of plants with a number of possible hiding places is greatly appreciated. Corys are easy to feed, they are omnivores eating all flake and pelleted food and also live and frozen foods. When it comes to sperm, then the female glues the eggs, only a few in number, to the chosen substrate and then (sometimes) quickly touches them with her mouth. After several acts of spawning, which span a total of two to three hours, one female will have produced up to 200 eggs. Frequently, two males are used for each female, as one male has difficulty fertilizing all the eggs. The eggs gradually grow darker in color, and just prior to hatching (ranging from three days at 28\u00a0\u00b0C to a week at 20\u00a0\u00b0C) they turn dark brown. The fry keep to the bottom of the tank, feeding on detritus and any fine foods available. The parents may spawn again within two to three weeks. The albino corydoras is an albino variety of the bronze corydoras that has been developed for the aquarium trade, with a pale pink or orange body and red eyes.  It is physically similar to normally-colored individuals, although some breeders report that the fry are a little slower to develop.[10] Others say that the albinos are practically blind and that the males are somewhat sterile, although this may be due to extensive inbreeding.[11] Albino bronze corydoras are frequently injected with bright dye (via a needle) and sold in aquariums. This controversial practice is known as \"painting\" or \"juicing\" fish."

It lays eggs in dense vegetation, and adults do not guard the eggs. Unlike most Corydoras species but similar to the other \"saddlenoses\", C. narcissus tend to occur in small groups (not larger groups) and especially during the breeding period mature males are quite aggressive towards each other.[3][7] The species was first collected by Herbert R. Axelrod and Martin R. Brittan. It was first described and named narcissus by Han Nijssen and Isa\u00e4c J. H. Isbr\u00fccker to recognize the collectors \"for their many naming suggestions\".[8]"

        "description": " The dwarf corydoras (Corydoras hastatus), dwarf catfish, tail spot pygmy catfish, or micro catfish is a tropical freshwater fish belonging to the subfamily Corydoradinae of the family Callichthyidae.  It originates in inland waters in South America, and is found in the Amazon River and Paraguay River basins in Argentina, Bolivia, and Brazil.[1] The specific epithet hastatus means with a spear, in reference to the spearhead-like spot on the tail root. The body of Corydoras hastatus is typically more elongated than other Corydoras species.  Its body is a translucent white to olive color, with a thin dark stripe on the sides from behind the gill cover to the root of the tail, and a whitish belly.  It has a white crescent at the base of the tail surrounding a black spot.  The fish will grow in length up to 1.4 inches (3.5\u00a0cm), but 1.0 inch (2.5\u00a0cm) is more typical.  Males are smaller, more slender and have a more pointed dorsal fin than females. The dwarf corydoras lives in a (sub)tropical climate in water with a 6.0\u20138.0 pH, a water hardness of 5\u201319 dGH, and a temperature range of 68\u201382 F (20\u201328\u00a0\u00b0C).[1] It is found in ponds.[1] It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. They are found in the Paraguay River and Amazon River basins. C. hastatus lives among plants.[1] It is a schooling species.[1] It differs from most Corydoras species by preferring the midwater areas instead of the bottom, spending most of its time well off the bottom in areas of dense plants.  When it rests, it rests on the leaves of the plants.  Other Corydoras species with similar mid-water habits include C. habrosus and C. pygmaeus. The dwarf Corydoras maintains its position in a current by using rapid fin movements, especially with its pectoral fins. These rapid movements, combined with a high breathing rate, give the fish the appearance of being very \"nervous\" when compared with other fish. C. hastatus may even shoal with small characins. The fish lays its eggs in dense vegetation and the adults do not guard the eggs.  The female holds a single egg between her pelvic fins, where the male fertilizes them for about 30 seconds.  Only then does the female swim to a suitable spot, where she attaches the sticky egg. The pair repeats this process about every three minutes for from one to two hours with some 10- to 15-minute rests between egg releases.  Around 7 to 15 eggs are spawned in a single day, and spawning occurs on three to four consecutive days. A total of 30 to 60 eggs may be spawned by a single female over this period of time. The eggs hatch in three to nine days.  The fry are about 6\u00a0mm long at hatching, mostly translucent but sometimes with spots. In two months, the fry average about 18\u00a0mm in length.  The fry mature in six to eight months. The dwarf corydoras is of commercial importance in the aquarium trade industry.   Due to its small size, this fish can be kept in a relatively small aquarium; a 5-gallon (20 litre) tank is sufficient for a small school.  Since it is a schooling fish, it should only be kept in groups of at least six individuals.  It is a good community tank fish when kept with peaceful tankmates such as tetras, rasboras, and danios, but should not be kept with overly aggressive tankmates.  They have also been used as scavengers for fry tanks. The aquarium should be clean, well-aerated, and densely planted to provide hiding places.  A moderate current provided by a power filter or canister filter is appreciated.  The water should be slightly alkaline (pH about 7.6) within a temperature range of 24\u00b0 to 29\u00a0\u00b0C.  Although the fish is generally a mid-water dweller, a fine gravel or sand substrate should be provided since it will occasionally burrow. The fish will feed both in midwater or on a substrate, whether that substrate is a plant leaf, a broad rock, or the bottom of the tank.  It accepts most foods, including freeze-dried, flake, and frozen foods, although live foods are particularly appreciated. The methods of spawning this fish in the aquarium is similar to spawning most other Corydoras species.  The spawning tank can be as small as 2.5 gallons (10 L), but at least a 5-gallon (20 L) tank is recommended with aged water, a sponge filter and some plants.  Fish should be conditioned with large amounts of live foods such as Tubifex and whiteworms, during which time the females will become noticeably plumper.  Since C. hastatus may spawn as a school, the whole group can be conditioned for spawning at the same time, and for best results, there should be at least two males for every female. Spawning of well-conditioned fish may be initiated by the addition of cooler water.  During spawning, very little food is accepted, but the fish will immediately search for food after finishing.  It will typically attach its eggs to the plants in the aquarium, but if not enough plants are available, the sides of the aquarium may be used.  When the fry hatch, they can be fed newly hatched brine shrimp or microworms.  The parents may be ready to spawn again in a couple of weeks."

The fish's appearance is characterized by dark double longitudinal stripes. The dorsal fin is ornamented by a few gray dots, taking on an arching pattern in some individuals. The body has other gray and black markings on an olive background. Compared with other species of Corydoras, the body is not as tall in comparison to its length, and its eyes are set a bit lower. The fish will grow in length up to 5.1 centimetres (2.0 inches). It lives in a tropical climate in water with a 6.0 - 8.0 pH, a water hardness of 2 \u2013 25 dGH, and a temperature range of 22\u201326\u00a0\u00b0C (72\u201379\u00a0\u00b0F). It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. Though it lays eggs in dense vegetation, adults do not guard them. In captivity, the male is reportedly territorial during the prespawning activities while the female is usually hidden among the plant roots. Both sexes clean the underside of plant leaves. Eggs are fastened under the leaves and are also attached to roots of plants. The elegant corydoras is of commercial importance in the aquarium trade industry. It tends to swim in the upper levels of the aquarium, instead of at the bottom as is common with most species of Corydoras, and does not seem to disturb the sediment as much."

        "description": " Corydoras panda is a species of catfish belonging to the genus Corydoras, of the family Callichthyidae, and is a native member of the riverine fauna of South America.  It is found in Peru and Ecuador, most notably in the Hu\u00e1nuco region, where it inhabits the R\u00edo Aquas, the R\u00edo Amarillae, a tributary of the R\u00edo Pachitea, and the R\u00edo Ucayali river system. The species was first collected by Randolph H. Richards in 1968, and was named Corydoras panda by Nijssen and Isbr\u00fccker in 1971. The specific name is an allusion to the appearance of the fish, which possesses large black patches surrounding the eyes, reminiscent of those found on the giant panda. Accordingly, the common names for this fish, which is a popular aquarium species, are panda corydoras and panda catfish. Corydoras panda has an off-white to pinkish-orange ground colour, and when observed under certain lighting conditions, a faint greenish iridescence is present upon the flanks and the operculum. The fins of the fish match the body in ground colour, upon close inspection being seen to be hyaline or translucent with coloured fin rays, with the dorsal fin being marked by a conspicuous black blotch that covers almost the entire fin area. The caudal peduncle is marked with a black band, this black band encircling the caudal peduncle from dorsal to ventral surface. The adipose fin, supported by a small fin spine, sometimes contains black pigmentation. The head is the same ground colour as the body, with a black mask surrounding the eyes, descending vertically from the fontanel, over each eye, and ending in a triangular wedge immediately before the ventral surface of the head. The pectoral fins are positioned immediately behind the operculum, and are usually oriented horizontally when the fish is at rest, extended in a manner similar to the wings of an aeroplane. The pelvic fins are positioned upon the ventral surface of the fish, located some way behind the pectoral fins. The first ray of the dorsal fin emanates from the body at approximately its point of greatest elevation, and a vertical line drawn downwards from this point meets the attachment point of the pelvic fins. The anal fin is located far to the rear of the ventral surface of the body, the attachment point of the first fin ray being somewhat forward of the black caudal peduncle marking described above. In common with all other members of the family Callichthyidae, the body surface is covered, not with scales, but with bony plates known as scutes. The lines of demarcation between individual scutes can be seen upon close examination of this and almost all other Callichthyid fishes, and in the case of some specimens of this species, are highlighted by additional black pigment. The fish possesses, in common with almost all Corydoras species, three pairs of barbels\u2014one pair of maxillary barbels and two pairs of rictal barbels. A fully mature adult specimen of this species attains a standard length of 55 millimetres (2.1\u00a0inches): this is the length attained by mature females, which grow larger than mature males, and also possess more rounded body outlines. Corydoras panda inhabits clear river waters that are relatively fast-flowing, well-oxygenated, and flowing over substrates that may comprise soft sand or fine gravel. These rivers are usually well vegetated with assorted species of aquatic plants. The proximity of the home rivers of the fish to the Andes mountain range, and the replenishment of those rivers with meltwaters from Andean snows at higher altitudes, has led the fish to be adaptable to cooler temperatures than the norm for 'tropical' fishes\u2014the temperature range of the fish is 16\u00a0\u00b0C to 28\u00a0\u00b0C, though the fish exhibits a marked preference for the cooler regions of this temperature spectrum, particularly in captivity. Indeed, the fish can, for small time-periods, survive temperatures as low as 12\u00a0\u00b0C, though captive rearing at such low temperatures is ill-advised. The native waters of Corydoras panda are consequently mineral-deficient, with a neutral to slightly acid pH, and replication of such conditions in captivity are recommended for successful maintenance. Corydoras panda has a preference for cooler than normal waters when compared to many other popular tropical fish species. Because of this, those who keep C. panda in community aquarium setting must choose tankmates that share its preference for cooler temperatures of around 20\u00a0\u00b0C (68\u00a0\u00b0F) to 25\u00a0\u00b0C (77\u00a0\u00b0F).[2] Given the cleanliness of the fish's native waters, scrupulous attention to water quality in the aquarium is considerably more important for this fish than for the more domesticated Corydoras species such as C. paleatus or C. aeneus. Additionally, scrupulous attention to aquarium substrate cleanliness is a must, as the fish are intolerant of poor aquarium maintenance in this area, and succumb to stress and disease rapidly if their aquaria are not kept to a high standard. Despite this, the species remains highly popular with aquarists, upon account of the appearance of the fish, and its lively, vivacious behaviour in a well-planned aquarium setting. Like many other Corydoras species, the panda catfish is a highly gregarious fish, and in common with several other smaller Corydoras species such as C. habrosus and C. pygmaeus, manifests a distinct need for numerous companions of its own species in order to thrive, and can thus be described as being more avowedly social than some of the larger members of the genus. A minimum of eight individuals should be housed in the same aquarium, and if space permits, this number should be revised upwards, as the fish exhibits a very definite preference for grouping together with others of its species. They also associate themselves easily with the clown loach and school together in currents where sufficient numbers of their own species is lacking. An aquarium for this species should be well furnished, ideally with a mixture of live aquatic plants, and solid furnishings providing caves, sheltered areas and hiding places to give the fish security. Floating plants to provide additional areas of shade are also welcomed by the fish. Like all Corydoras species, the fish feeds primarily upon animal matter. The aquarist is advised, however, that the traditional use of Corydoras catfishes as putative 'scavengers' in an aquarium setting will be detrimental to the well-being of this species\u2014it requires high quality foods for long-term maintenance, and a varied diet. Ideally, the fish should be given live foods at least intermittently, and will dine enthusiastically upon such items as Bloodworms (larvae of Chironomus midges), Daphnia, cultivated Brine Shrimp (Atermia salina), and Tubifex worms. The last, however, should be cultivated in order to minimise the risk of introducing pathogenic organisms to the aquarium, as Tubifex live in unsanitary conditions in the wild. Freeze dried Tubifex may be preferable, as the risk of introduction of disease is eliminated. High quality flake foods are also appreciated, particularly those containing shrimp or other similar matter. The lifespan of Corydoras panda in the aquarium has not been systematically determined, but given the longevity of other Corydoras species in the aquarium, it is reasonable to assume that well-cared for specimens will enjoy a lifespan in excess of ten years, and frequently in excess of 15 years. Corydoras panda follows, with a few minor deviations, the standard model for breeding for the genus. Stimulus for breeding consists of the influx of cooler, oxygenated waters into their habitat, usually corresponding in the wild with the onset of the rainy season. However, while some Corydoras species require a temperature drop in the aquarium for spawning to be stimulated, in the case of Corydoras panda, the temperature drop appears to matter much less, as specimens have spawned in the aquarium without a temperature drop. The addition of new, clean, oxygenated water appears to be the primary stimulus for this species. In the wild, the appearance of new water courtesy of the rains is followed by an increase in the populations of assorted food organisms, and feeding upon these conditions the fishes for breeding. Once conditioned fish are stimulated into spawning, males begin chasing females energetically. Females begin developing eggs within their reproductive tracts, and when 'ripe' (laden with eggs), become receptive to the attentions of the males. Eventually, one male will succeed in courting a female, using his barbels to provide stimulation to the female, usually beginning with caresses of the female's caudal peduncle, followed by caresses of the fontanel and the front of the head. if the female is receptive, then the male positions himself before the female, so that the female's mouth is in close proximity with one of the male's pectoral fins. The male then clasps the female's barbels between the pectoral fin and the body, and this stimulates the female to press against the male's side. When seen from above, the fish form a 'T' shape when conjoined thus, hence the term 'T position' has become conventional in aquarium circles when describing the breeding of Corydoras catfishes. Once the male and female are in the 'T position', the pressing of the female against the male's body stimulates his release of sperm. Though the exact mechanism of fertilisation has yet to be scientifically documented, from the observations of aquarists who have been successful in breeding Corydoras catfishes, it seems likely that the female takes the male's sperm through her mouthparts, and directs them through the gills, in a current that carries the sperm to her pelvic fins. At this point, the female releases a single egg (occasionally two), and purses her pelvic fins in order to provide a receptacle for the freshly extruded egg, which is then fertilised. One difference observed between the adoption of the 'T position' in Corydoras panda, when compared to other Corydoras species, is that the exercise is frequently more acrobatic in appearance, with the 'T position' being adopted in mid-water, some distance above the substrate, rather than resting upon the substrate as is the case with the majority of other Corydoras. Once the female is carrying a fertilised egg within her pelvic fins, she then seeks an egg deposition site. The choice of such a site is frequently, though not always, a mass of fine leaved aquatic vegetation. In the aquarium, the plant known as Java moss, Vesicularia dubayana, is of considerable utility as an egg repository for Corydoras catfishes, even though the plant is not a South American native, and panda catfish females will choose large clumps of this plant readily as safe deposition sites for fertilised eggs. The female is frequently pursued by one or more males as she seeks the deposition site, each male presumably seeking to be the chosen mate to fertilise the next egg. Up to 25 eggs may be produced by a single female during a single spawning, which may take place over four to five hours. Fertile Corydoras panda eggs require approximately 3\u20134 days development time before hatching, if kept at a temperature of 22\u00a0\u00b0C. This development time will vary with temperature, taking longer in cooler water. Upon hatching, the fry are four millimetres long, translucent, but already possessing the basic ground colour of the species, and upon close examination, possess fully formed barbels. Even newly hatched fry possess at least some hint of the adult eye patches, and as the fry grow, these patches darken and become more prominent. Even so, at just four millimetres in length, the fry are practically invisible against typical aquarium gravel unless seen to move. The fry take approximately four weeks to develop to the point where the finfold, a continuous undifferentiated membrane resembling that seen at the posterior of a tadpole, has differentiated into the unpaired fins (dorsal, anal and caudal fins). During this time, size will have increased to approximately eight or nine millimetres, and the fish will begin to develop colour changes leading to that of the adult fish. From this point, the caudal peduncle patch and dorsal fin patch will begin to appear, but the body will also be seen to be covered in fine black 'pepper dots' between these black patches. Only after a period of 10 to 12 weeks, at which point the fish has assumed a size of 12 to 14 millimetres, will the fish attain the colouration of the adult, and be in all respects a perfect miniature of the parents. Fry of this species are particularly sensitive to changes in water chemistry and to elevated temperatures. While adult fishes can withstand temperatures of 28\u00a0\u00b0C, fry will die of heat stress if exposed to temperatures above 26\u00a0\u00b0C, and their chances of survival are enhanced if the water temperature is kept at 22\u00a0\u00b0C or below. Water changes made to a nursery aquarium during the first 21 days of life of the fry\u2014the critical period during which they manifest the greatest sensitivity to their environment\u2014must be gradual, and the incoming water conditioned to match that of the existing aquarium water where possible before the water change takes place. While the fry are likely to develop best if given infusoria as part of their feeding r\u00e9gime, it is possible to raise fry to adulthood entirely upon prepared foods."

        "description": " Corydoras paleatus is a species of catfish (order Siluriformes) of the family Callichthyidae. Its common names include blue leopard corydoras, mottled corydoras, and peppered catfish.[1] It originates from the lower Paran\u00e1 River basin and coastal rivers in Uruguay and Brazil.[1] This fish species reach about 5.9 - 7 centimeters (2.3 - 2.75 \u00a0in) SL.[1] The male is smaller than the female, and in proportion to body length, the dorsal fin and pectoral fins are longer on the male than the female.[2] Corydoras paleatus is found in the Amazon basin,[1] and feeds on worms, crustaceans, insects, and plant matter.[1] C. paleatus has been known to produce sound; it does this by the abduction of its pectoral fins. This is used by males during courtship and intrapersonal communication, and by both sexes and juveniles when distressed.[2] In reproduction, males do not behave aggressively toward each other, nor do they monopolize mating areas or females.[2] The T-position is involved in courtship, as with many other Corydoras species.[2] Charles Darwin discovered the C. paleatus when he went to Buenos Aires during his expedition aboard the Beagle during the 1830s.[3] It is a very good choice for the community aquarium, as it is a hardy,[4] good-looking, and peaceful fish.[4] They can be successfully kept with other small, peaceful aquarium fish like livebearers, danios, and tetras. It is sometimes seen in the shops as an albino form, although this is similar to other albino corys (see the C. aeneus albino form). It grows to around 7.5\u00a0cm and is easily bred at home. These fish prefer a planted tank with temperatures around 16 to 24 \u00b0C (61 \u2013 75 \u00b0F), although they can take lower temperatures than this as it originates from colder waters.[3] Their high temperature tolerance seems poor, and 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F) is the highest safe temperature. They like to nibble on the algae that grow on floating plants but are not specialized algae-eating catfish. The lighting must not be too bright, and hiding places, such as bogwood, are needed as they like to hide from the light during certain parts of the day. Heavily planted areas should also be provided, where the light is minimized, as they like darker areas due to their bottom-feeding nature. Diet should be sinking pellets, algae wafers, frozen and live food, such as bloodworm or daphnia. They may also occasionally enjoy blanched spinach, which can be attached to plants with a peg or the side of the glass with magnetic clips. They can be seen to dart to the top of the tank: this is because they can use atmospheric oxygen to supplement what their gills extract from the water.[5] They will do this more frequently  when water quality is starting to deteriorate, and so should be watched for this indication. Peppered corydoras reach their sexual maturity and start to show reproductive behaviors once the females reach an average (minimum) size of 5.625 cm (2.214 inches) and once the males reach about 4.875 cm (1.919 inches).[citation needed] The males initiate the courtship ritual, which entails chasing the females around the tank. The female darts away, and the males search for her and find her a few moments later. The males shiver all over the female and may lie down on top of her. When she is ready to spawn, she turns to the male next to her and pounds below his ventral fin. The pair go into the \"T-position\" with the male releasing the sperm into the female's mouth before the sperm fertilizes the eggs[citation needed]. The female cups her ventral fins and lays a few eggs (usually between 4 and 12 eggs[citation needed]) in her fins.  The eggs are about 1.8 mm in diameter[citation needed]. The female now starts cleaning a spot on the glass to put her eggs on. Corydoras are egg depositors and lay their eggs all over the aquarium. Favorite spots include the heater, filters, and the glass, although, occasionally eggs are also laid on plants and driftwood. After depositing a group of eggs closely together, the female rests for a few moments. The males regroup and start chasing each other and then resume chasing the female. The males are so relentless in this pursuit that they try to mate with the female even while she is busy laying her eggs. The spawning lasts more than an hour, and many eggs are laid in different places. On average, about 50 to 150 eggs are laid during a single spawning[citation needed]. The incubation period for the eggs for peppered corydoras was found to be between 96 hours and 113 hours at 24\u00b12\u00b0C, with the average incubation period being about 102 hours (or 4.25 days)[citation needed]. In one study, the average hatching ratio of the eggs was found to be approximately 87%, with the overall egg-laying period lasting between 20 and 35 days[citation needed]. Peppered cories can eat their eggs, but will not eat the living fry.  At first, the fry is small (with a mean length of 7.5246 mm[citation needed]) and is unable to eat, sustaining themselves on the last of their yolk sacs. The fry will begin to eat 1\u20133 days after hatching, and will eat the protozoan organisms in the tank and can be fed powdered food at this stage.  By about one month, the fry will start to become rounder and will begin developing adult coloration, eventually becoming miniature versions of the adults[citation needed]. The juveniles will reach adult size at around 1 year of age, although this varies between individuals and how well they are kept. The age of sexual maturity also varies between individuals, but juveniles will typically begin breeding at around 8\u201312 months of age. However, they can begin as early as 6 months and as late as 18 months of age. From the onset of sexual maturity, it can take the fish up to another year to successfully produce fertile eggs; at first, entire clutches of eggs may be infertile. Albino strains may develop slower and be less fertile due to inbreeding. Media related to Corydoras paleatus at Wikimedia Commons"

        "description": " Corydoras pygmaeus, or the pygmy corydoras or pygmy catfish[1] is a tropical and freshwater fish belonging to the subfamily Corydoradinae of the family Callichthyidae. It originates in tropical inland waters in South America, and is found in the Madeira River basin in Brazil. The first scientific description of the pygmy corydoras was published in 1966 by German biologist and physician Joachim Knaack, in Aquarien und Terrarien-Zeitschrift.[2][3] One specimen was designated the holotype and one additional specimen was collected as a paratype.[2] The scientific name uses the Latin word pygmaeus, meaning dwarf or pygmy.[4] A species of Corydoras with a similar appearance, Corydoras hastatus was described in the 1880s, and many specimens that were described as Corydoras hastatus between the 1920s and 1950s were subsequently found to be misidentified specimens of the pygmy corydoras.[1] In older literature, the pygmy corydoras is frequently mislabeled due to Corydoras hastatus being the only miniature Corydoras species known at the time.[1] The pygmy corydoras is a silver-colored fish, with an unbroken black line that runs horizontally along the center of the sides of the fish from the tip of its snout to its caudal peduncle.[5] It has a second thin black line along the lower part of the side of the body, from behind the ventral fins and continuing into the tail.[5] The top part of the body has a light black or dark gray shading that starts on the top of its snout and ends at the tail.[5] Newly hatched fry have vertical stripes along the sides of their bodies that fade by the end of their first month, when the horizontal stripes of the adult fish begin to appear.[5] The maximum length of the species is about 3.2 centimeters (1.3\u00a0in),[6] but typical adult sizes are 1.9 centimeters (0.75\u00a0in) for males and 2.5 centimeters (1.0\u00a0in) for females.[1] In addition to their larger length, females are also rounder and broader than males, especially when they have eggs.[7] Young fry grow rapidly after hatching, reaching 13 millimeters (0.51\u00a0in) in six to eight weeks.[1] The pygmy corydoras is widely distributed in inland waters in Peru in tributaries of the Nanay River, in Ecuador in tributaries of the Aguarico River, and in western Brazil in tributaries of the Madeira River.[8] The holotype was obtained from Calama, Brazil, along the Madeira River near the mouth of the Ji-Paran\u00e1 River.[6] The pygmy corydoras lives in a tropical climate in water with a 6.0 - 8.0 pH,[9] a water hardness of 2 \u2013 25 dGH,[9] and a temperature range of 22\u201326\u00a0\u00b0C (72\u201379\u00a0\u00b0F).[9] It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. The pygmy corydoras lays approximately 100 eggs at a time.[9] The female holds 2\u20134 eggs at a time in a pouch formed by her pelvic fins while they are fertilized by the male, which takes about 30 seconds.[9] The female swims to a safe location with the fertilized eggs, where she attaches the sticky eggs to a surface, where they will remain.[9] It is a peaceful fish, shoaling fish and can be kept in a community aquarium of smaller fish species such as ember tetras. It can be fed most sinking foods, flakes, frozen food and sinking wafers. It can be kept with small shrimp and snails. In aquariums, they are often kept on fine grained substrate, such as sand. This enables them to dig through the substrate without injury to their barbels, which can often be lost in sharp substrates. They are often kept at a pH of between 6.5 and 7.0. They are schooling fish that are usually kept in groups of at least four and will also behave much more naturally in larger groups (10 or more). Unlike the larger more common Corydoras, they often swim in shoals around the mid water and lower regions of the tank. C. pygmaeus are peaceful fish which will not thrive with aggressive tankmates. They are perhaps best kept in a planted species tank, or with shrimp such as Neocaridina spp. They seem to do best when offered live foods in addition to prepared food items. Appropriate foods include microworms or similar nematodes, as well as Artemia nauplii (newly hatched brine shrimp)."

It originates in inland waters in South America, and is found in the Upper Orinoco River basin in Venezuela and Colombia. C. habrosus, is often found in periodic wetlands, large floodplains to where other species migrate seasonally. These small corydoras are prone to entrapment in receding waters, and populations can suffer during the dry season.[2] Their natural habitat tends to be abundant in leaf litter and plant life, providing ample cover to allow these fish to roam moderately freely. As a bottom dwelling species C. habrosus tends to stick to the lower regions of the river, however, on occasion corydoras will dart up to the water surface to take in air. They use their intestines as an air breathing organ to absorb oxygen, and expel the remnant air out of the anus.[3] The fish will grow in length up to 1.4 inches (3.5 centimeters). It lives in a tropical climate in water with a 5.5 \u2013 7.5 pH, a water hardness of 2 \u2013 10 dGH, and a temperature of about 77\u00a0\u00b0F (25\u00a0\u00b0C).[4] The diet consists of worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. It is a peaceful fish and can be kept in a community aquarium of smaller fish species such as ember tetras, clown panchax, endler guppies and small species of rasbora.  It should be kept in groups of at least 6 individuals, ideally 10 or more. A shoal should be kept in a tank that is at least 14 gallons in size.[5] Salt and pepper catfish can be fed most small sinking foods including pellets, flake food and preserved baby brine shrimp. Frozen foods such as baby brine shrimp, rotifers and cyclops can also be fed either regularly or exclusively. In captivity, breeding can be difficult to achieve. Some aquarists report that large water changes with relatively cold water can stimulate habrosus in to spawning.[6] Spawning is marked by obvious behaviours; males will swim close to the female, if multiple males are present they will surround the female swimming from side to side quickly. The female holds an egg visibly under her ventral fin ready for fertilising. The female can then be seen to 'massage' the males belly. The female will then choose an appropriate place to deposit her egg, usually on plants near the substrate, particularly on the underside of the leaves but can also be found on the aquarium glass and decor.  Eggs are rarely placed on the top of the leaves or close to the water surface. The spawning male will protect the female from other males attempting to spawn with her.

The fish is native to the Guapor\u00e9 River region between Bolivia and Brazil.[1] Sterba's cory is distinguishable from other Corydoras species as it has white spots on a black background on its head. It is occasionally confused with Corydoras haraldschultzi; the difference is that the latter has a pattern of black dots on a white background on the head.  C. sterbai has recently become available in an albino form and a black form. Like many Corydoras species, Sterba's corydoras is a shoaling catfish, and thus should ideally be kept in groups of 5 or more. In the wild it can be found in Brazil and thus, wild caught fish prefer soft, acidic water. However, Sterba's corydoras is a hardy fish and tank bred specimens have adapted to a wider range of water conditions. However, like almost all fish it will not tolerate high levels of nitrates. Unlike some other catfish they are not good algae eaters, but are good at \"cleaning up\" leftover food and detritus from the substrate. Corydoras sterbai are relatively small for catfish, growing to a maximum size of only 2\u20132.6 inches (5.1\u20136.6\u00a0cm). In captivity Corydoras sterbai readily accepts a wide variety of prepared and frozen foods. Flake food is a good staple diet (which will only be consumed once it has fallen to the bottom) as are sinking pellets or wafers. They relish live and frozen foods such as bloodworm, daphnia and mosquito larvae, but ideally should only be fed such foods once a week due to the high amount of protein in them. It is often problematic to feed Corydoras in aquaria with fast feeding mid-water fish such as tetras as flake and sinking pellets are consumed by such fish before they have hit the bottom and sometimes, even while lying on the substrate. However, this problem can be overcome by placing pellets and flake on the aquarium substrate in caves or under bogwood, or other such areas which are not regularly frequented by mid-water fish. The compatibility of C. sterbai is one of their main selling points as with all other Corydoras species as they are very peaceful catfish and can be kept with other peaceful fish. They should not be kept with overly aggressive bottom dwellers, particularly if there is competition over substrate space as there would be in small tanks or tanks with a large amount of \"furniture\". Ideal companions would be similar sized tetras or particularly, dwarf cichlids. Ideally Corydoras sterbai should be housed with a fine substrate such as sand or gravel in order to avoid doing damage to their delicate barbels. However, large gravel will suffice as long as it is not sharp edged. Their only other requirement is that shade be provided for them, by means of overhanging rock, large leaved plants, arching bogwood or caves. Breeding is not too difficult. A tank with dimensions 18\u2033 x 12\u2033 x 12\u2033 (10 US Gallon) is recommended. The breeding ratio that should be kept is 2 males per female. Good diet together with repeated water changes and drops of temperature are usually sufficient. However, raising the fry is not easy due to its high sensitivity. Occasionally problems can arise while transporting these fish as they are capable of secreting a chemical toxin when stressed or overcrowded. For this reason they are never shipped with other fish. The species name of this Corydoras is in honour of Professor Dr. G\u00fcnther Sterba, professor emeritus of zoology of Leipzig University, member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.[2] Professor Sterba is a professional ichthyologist who nevertheless produced several very popular books regarded as virtual bibles for fishkeepers over the 1970s and 1980s, translated into English under the titles Freshwater Fishes of the World, Aquarium Care and (with Dick Mills) The Aquarists' Encyclopedia, despite his degree of isolation at that time by virtue of living in the then German Democratic Republic."

They are best differentiated by the stripes on the side. In C. trilineatus, the stripes are much more pronounced and solid than in C. julii.[citation needed]  This Callichthyidae-related article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it."

        "description": " Corydoras julii (also known as the julii cory or leopard catfish[2]) is a small freshwater catfish native to eastern Brazil. It is often confused with Corydoras trilineatus,[3] the three stripe corydoras. Corydoras julii are small, peaceful shoaling fish, and are typically kept in groups in captivity.[4] Corydoras julii is a relatively small species of fish, growing to be no more than 52 millimeters in length.[5] Its skin is a translucent whitish-gray, with fine black spotting across the body and a horizontal stripe which reaches up the mid-body until it is equal with the front base of the dorsal fin. This spotting pattern is the primary visual difference between C. julii and three stripe corydoras (C. trilineatus), which have larger reticulations, as opposed to spots, and a longer mid-body stripe. C. julii might be further distinguished from C. trilineatus by the spotted pattern on its head; however, C. trilineatus can also show this pattern on occasion.[5] Females are typically larger and rounder than males.[6] Corydoras julii, like almost all Corydoras species, are bottom-feeding scavengers. Their diet consists primarily of small invertebrates which they sift from the substrate, expelling the particles of sand and sediment through their gill openings. In captivity, their diet is frequently sinking pellets rich in insect and other invertebrate proteins, as well as live or frozen invertebrates like bloodworms, daphnia, brine shrimp, and California blackworms (Lumbriculus variegatus).[4] After sexual maturity, Corydoras spawning appears to be triggered by storms.[6] During this storm, the fish eat increased amounts of insects. The water gradually decreases temperature over the course of a few days.[6] Corydoras fish breed in a position resembling a \"T formation\". In this formation, the female swims up to the male's abdomen, and consumes sperm released by the male. The sperm rapidly travels though the female's intestinal tract and fertilizes the eggs in the cloaca. Small, white, sturdy eggs are laid on plant leaves in the wild. Adult corydoras have been known to eat their own eggs.[6]"

It was originally described as Silurus callichthys by Linnaeus in 1758.[1] It is likely to represent a species complex.[2] C. callichthys is distributed in all major river drainages of South America.[2] It is very wide-ranging, extending from Trinidad to  Buenos Aires, Argentina, including the upper Amazon River and Paraguay River systems. The fish will grow in length up to eight inches (20 centimeters).  The females are larger and more robust, and are a dull olive-green, while the males are brighter in color, exhibiting a delicate blue or violet sheen laterally, with a more developed and longer pectoral fin spine that is reddish-brown and edged with orange or reddish-orange. It lives in a variety of water types, from anoxic conditions (slack water zones surrounded by dense vegetation) to slightly turbid, but free-flowing, streams.[1] It can be found in waters with pH range of 5.8 to 8.3, a water hardness of 0\u201330dGH, and a temperature range of 64\u201383\u00a0\u00b0F (18\u201328\u00a0\u00b0C).[1] When its biotype becomes dry, it can move out of the water, due to its ability to swallow air and use its intestines to absorb oxygen from the atmosphere, to find more water.[1] It feeds at night on fish, insects, and plant matter.  Juveniles feed on rotifers, in addition to the microcrustaceans and aquatic insect larvae they find when digging into the substrate.[1] During reproduction, the male's belly turns orange and its pectoral spines become longer and thicker.  The male builds a bubble nest with some floating plants, fiercely guarding it after the female lays down her eggs.[1] The cascarudo is of commercial importance in the aquarium trade industry and of minor importance as a food source.[1] It can be kept in aquariums, with groups of more than five individuals recommended.[1]"

        "description": " Megalechis thoracata (black marble hoplo, spotted hoplo[1]) is a species of catfish of the family Callichthyidae.  M. thoracata is found east of the Andes in the Amazon, Orinoco, and upper Paraguay River basins, as well as in the coastal rivers of the Guianas and northern Brazil. Recent introductions were recorded in the upper Paran\u00e1 River drainage.[2] Overview: The Spotted Hoplo Catfish is an incredibly hardy and relatively easy species to keep in captivity, with the main difficulty being the maximum size of around 6 inches, or 15\u00a0cm.They are a very peaceful fish, with the only exception being when the males are guarding a bubble nest at breeding time. They can be kept with almost all tankmates, but they will likely eat anything that can fit in their mouths due to their opportunistic nature. This rule also applies for larger fish, as the Hoplo may get eaten or have its barbels or fins damaged by large, potentially aggressive fish, such as South American Cichlids, African Cichlids, larger catfish and most larger fish species that can fit the Hoplo in its mouth or shows aggression. Tank Setup: They require a soft sand substrate, as they are bottom dwellers that can often be observed foraging/searching for food. A gentle substrate is essential, as other coarse grained or abrasive substrates can irritate the fish's sensitive barbels, and even cause them to fall off. To thrive in the aquarium, they need a minimum tank size of 55 US liquid gallons, but as a rule of thumb for this fish, the larger the tank, the better.[3][4] They are semi-social creatures that prefer to be kept in groups of at least five, but still seem content alone or in pairs. The spotted hoplo catfish needs hiding places, usually in the form of rocks, wood and plants, such as variations of Anubias, valisineria, java fern and micranthemum. Floating plants are also appreciated, as they provide extra cover. Water Conditions: Despite the Hoplo being a very hardy fish, like all fish they need a mature, cycled tank with the correct parameters for almost all tropical species. As they are a species of tropical fish, the optimal temperature for them is around 24\u201328 degrees Celsius, but they can adapt to temperatures in the 22\u201330 degrees Celsius range, although this is not recommended and over a long period of time this can lead to elevated stress levels, amongst other health concerns. The natural habitat of Megalechis thoracata is slow flowing, low oxygen parts of the  Amazon, Orinoco, and upper Paraguay River basins. For this reason, catfish of the family Callichthyidae among other fish, have developed a unique way of breathing, where the fish will rise to the surface of the water and ingest a small amount of air.[5] The oxygen is then absorbed through the lining of the stomach and intestine. This is known as gastrointestinal respiration. They will feed on small to medium-sized worms and other invertebrates, small fish, and general detritus. M. thoracata has been observed to produce sounds during territorial behavior in males at their nest sites and especially during spawning, and during aggressive behavior in both sexes. M. thoracata males aggressively defend territories against intruders.[6]"

        "description": " Ancistrus is a genus of nocturnal freshwater fish in the family Loricariidae of order Siluriformes, native to freshwater habitats in South America and Panama. Fish of this genus are common in the aquarium trade where they are known as bushynose or bristlenose catfish. In the aquarium hobby they are often referred to as bushynose or bristlenose plecos instead, but this may lead to confusion as \"pleco\" usually is used for Hypostomus plecostomus and its allies and is often used as a catchall term for any loricariids remotely resembling that species. The type species is Ancistrus cirrhosus.[1] This genus is the largest genus within the tribe Ancistrini.[2] The name ancistrus derives from the Ancient Greek agkistron \"hook\"\u00a0\u2013 a reference to the form of the cheek odontodes. The genera Pristiancistrus, Thysanocara and Xenocara are now synonyms of Ancistrus.[2] Ancistrus species show all the typical features of the Loricariidae. This includes a body covered in bony plates and a ventral suckermouth.[3] The feature most commonly associated with the genus are the fleshy tentacles found on the head in adult males; females may possess tentacles along the snout margin but they are smaller and they lack tentacles on the head.[3] Tentacules, tentacles directly associated with odontodes, develop on the pectoral fin spine of the males of some species.[3] Males also have evertible cheek odontodes which are less developed or absent in females. They also lack odontodes along the snout.[2] In comparison with a typical loricariid (pleco), a bristlenose is typically shorter (4\u20136 inches or 15\u00a0cm or less), more flattened and fatter with a comparatively wider head. Colouration is typically mottled brown, grey or black. Small white or yellow spots are common.[2] In contrast to many other loricariid 'plecos' (many of which regularly exceed a foot in captivity), the bristlenose plecos do not usually exceed six inches in length; they can thus be kept in relatively small tanks, contributing to their popularity in the aquarium hobby. Ancistrus species are unusual among vertebrates in possessing an X0 sex-determination system, which is the prevailing method in many lineages of arthropod but is very rare elsewhere in the animal kingdom.[4] Ancistrus is one of the widest ranging Loricariid genera, and representatives are found in most areas where the family in general is present.[2] Many species are found in the rivers and floodplain areas of the Amazon basin, but there are also species elsewhere in tropical South America, as well as species on the island of Trinidad and two species, A. centrolepis and A. chagresi in Panama.[5] Three species are true cavefish (troglobites): A. cryptophthalmus, A. galani and A. formoso.[6][7] These are the only known loricariids that possess adaptions for a subterranean lifestyle, such as reduced pigmentation (appearing overall whitish) and eyes.[6] In the wild, Ancistrus species prefer flowing water, so tanks with flow are typically used when keeping them in captivity. Since they are bottom-dwelling fish, substrate is considered preferable to a bare tank floor. Mixtures of gravel, dirt, and clay are frequently used as substrate for Ancistrus. The aquarium size that is considered by some to be a minimum for fish of this genus is 25 gallons.[8] There are currently 76 recognized species in this genus:[9] The diet of this genus is typical for a Loricariid\u00a0\u2013 algae, aufwuchs, and detritus, with sediment, sand, and gravel presumably ingested accidentally alongside food items.[13][14][15][16][17][18] Despite reports among fish-keepers that they require wood in their diet, no scientific evidence to date supports members of this genus feeding on wood.  Bristlenoses do not school but hide when not feeding, juveniles however are typically found in brightly lit shallows at the water margin making them susceptible to predation by birds. Ancistrus species have the capability of obtaining oxygen through their modified stomach.[19] This allows them to survive in conditions with low oxygen levels.[2] Breeding takes place in hollows, caves and mud holes in banks. Males may clean the inside of the cavity with their suckermouth before allowing the female to approach and inspect the nest.  Courtship includes expanding the dorsal and caudal fins and attempts by the male to escort the female to the nest. While the female inspects the nest, the male keeps close contact.[3] The female may lay 20\u2013200 adhesive eggs, usually to the ceiling of the cavity.[3] The female plays no role in parental care; the male takes care of its young. Males will clean the eggs and the cavity with its fins and mouth. Males inspect eggs to remove diseased or infertile eggs, and aerates the clutch by fanning them with its pectoral and pelvic fins.[3] During this time, a male usually will not leave the cavity to feed, or will leave only occasionally and quickly return.[3] The eggs hatch in 4\u201310 days over a period of 2\u20136 hours; the male guards the eggs for 7\u201310 days after hatching.[3] The fry remain in the cave, attaching to the walls and ceiling with their mouths, absorbing their yolk sac in 2\u20134 days and becoming free swimming.[3] Males of these species are competitive and territorial. Males display to each other by positioning themselves parallel to each other, head to tail, with dorsal and caudal fins erect and cheek odontode spines everted. If this escalates to combat, the males will circle each other and direct attacks at the head.[3] If an intruding male manages to evict another male from the nest, it may cannibalize the other male's young.[3] A male bristlenose may guard several clutches of eggs simultaneously. Females prefer males that are already protecting eggs and may prefer males that are protecting larvae; it has been suggested that the tentacles may act as a fry mimic to attract females, which would allow males without eggs in their nest to compete with males guarding eggs.[3] Several clutches in various states of development from eggs to free-swimming larvae can be found in one nest.[2] These fish are often kept by aquarists, as they are dutiful algae-eaters and smaller in adult size than the common plecos usually seen in pet shops. They reach up to 15\u00a0cm in males, and 12\u00a0cm in females. Their recommended temperature is 23\u201327 degrees Celsius. Their lifespan is up to 12 years. They are hardy animals, tolerant to a wide range of water conditions. They breed easily in captivity, and are compatible with most other freshwater fish. Though typically mottled brown or black-and-grey spotted in color, other species are more exotic\u00a0\u2013 spots of bright yellow on a dark background being a common pattern. Albino variants are also common. The albino morph is not caused by exposure to light during development, it is a morph controlled by genetics.[20] Historically, commonly available species of Ancistrus were Ancistrus cirrhosus and Ancistrus temminckii; other species are now available, though exact identification is difficult. Feeding is easy, bristlenoses will graze on algae/ algae wafers and other surface growing organisms as well as eating algae wafers or tablets, flake food, squash, spinach, cucumber, zucchini, green beans peas and even sliced carrots. They have also been known to accept frozen bloodworms as part of their diet. Aquarium specimens may starve for lack of algae or other plant matter; algae wafers or other low-protein foods are recommended. Keepers should watch for the abdomen to take on a sunken appearance, indicating insufficient nutrition. Sexing is very easy as the female will only occasionally have bristles, around the edge of the chin, whereas the male will have them up the center of the head. Breeding is also possible. Males attract females to a small cave or hollow, then guard eggs after fertilization through hatching (4\u20138 days) until fry are free swimming (4\u20136 days after hatching); the aquarist need only supply a suitable cave, food, and one of each sex. Caution should be taken with the spines (odontodes)\u00a0; although the risk of personal injury is small with this genus, the hooked nature of the odontodes means that a bristlenose may become trapped in non-natural material such as sponge filters and netting."

They inhabit flowing sections of rivers, especially clearwater, in the basins of the Amazon (notably Trombetas, Tapaj\u00f3s, Xingu and Tocantins) and Orinoco (notably Ventuari) in Brazil and Venezuela. The largest species reach up to 34\u00a0cm (13\u00a0in) in total length.[2] Most Baryancistrus are differentiated from other related genera by a membrane connecting their dorsal fin and adipose fin, not present in most other genera.[3] The species of this genus are mainly herbivores and detritivores, but may take other foods in an aquarium setting. Most have probably not been bred in captivity. It is difficult to sex these fish, including adult specimens. These fish are mainly nocturnal, but will also emerge from their hiding places during the day, after some time getting accustomed to the aquarium. Adequate hiding places are recommended for these fish due to their primary nocturnal nature. There are currently eight recognized species in this genus:[2][4] Though there are many types of fish described as Baryancistrus, there are many that yet to be given a true scientific designation, and are only referred to under the L-number system, including the Gold Nuggets. Here is a list of Baryancistrus by L-number designation. The common name and scientific name are included when available, though some of these fish are only commonly referred to by their L-number. For those fish without a scientific name, they are assumed to be Baryancistrus sp. * Note: L200 is also used to refer to Hemiancistrus subviridis, another Loricariid that is very similar in appearance to B. demantoides.

        "description": " Rineloricaria (from the Greek, rhinos meaning nose, and the Latin, lorica meaning cuirass of leather) is a genus of freshwater tropical catfish (order Siluriformes) belonging to the family Loricariidae. They are commonly called whiptail catfish because of the long filament that grows out of the tip of the caudal fin that is characteristic of the genus. With the exception of R. altipinnis from Panama, they are native to the rivers of northern and central South America. Some species are regularly seen in the aquarium trade. This genus was described by Pieter Bleeker in 1862, with R. lima as the type species.[1] This genus is by far one of the most speciose of the subfamily Loricariinae, containing about 30 species.[2] On the other hand, it is one of the least resolved genera.[3] In 2008, 14 new species were added to this genus.[2][4][5][6][7] Hemiloricaria, Fonchiiichthys, and Leliella been variably considered synonyms of Rineloricaria; these genera were erected to account for differences in sexually dimorphic traits. However, the traits used to diagnose these genera have been thought to be insufficient.[2] There are currently 67 recognized species in this genus:[8] The genus is widely distributed on nearly the entire subcontinent, from Costa Rica to Argentina, on both slopes of the Andes.[11] Rineloricaria species are found in a large variety of habitats, including large rivers, streams, and lagoons, associated with bottoms consisting of sand or rocks, sometimes found in marginal vegetation. They are also found to tolerate environments with a wide temperature gradient.[6] Rineloricaria have an adaptive capacity enabling many species to exploit the most varied habitats; some species, such as R. strigilata, have been caught in highly polluted bodies of water and represent some of the main components of the ichthyological diversity in such habitats.[3] The average length of a Rineloricaria catfish is about 13\u00a0cm (5\u00a0in) long.[citation needed] The fish are long, slender, have no visible barbels, an erect dorsal fin, a very thin caudal peduncle, and a narrow face. The coloration of the fishes is usually light brown with darker blotches, and have a dark dorsal fin.[citation needed] They are also covered with bony plates and have a sucker disk mouth, as is common with most fish in the family Loricariidae. Sexual dimorphism includes hypertrophied development of the odontodes along the sides of the head, on the pectoral spines and rays, and predorsal area of mature males. Several species also show hypertrophied development of the odontodes on the entire caudal peduncle.[11] In males, the pectoral fin spine is often thick, short, and curved when compared to the female.[2] Rineloricaria are cavity brooders. Numerous eggs (often more than 100) are laid attached to one another in single layer masses on the cavity floor, and are brooded by males.[11] Rineloricaria exhibit high levels of karyotypic diversity with chromosome numbers ranging from 36 to 70.[11]"

This genus has a unique body shape that resembles a thin stick of wood. The body is slender and elongate, often with a pronounced rostrum and a brownish color with two lateral dark stripes beginning at the tip of the rostrum, passing over the eyes and ending at the tail, which are periodically interrupted on the caudal peduncle.[1] The genus is placed within the tribe Harttiini of the subfamily Loricariinae. Morphological, molecular and phylogenetic studies have placed Farlowella as sister to Sturisoma.[1] The genus name of Farlowella is named in honor of William Gilson Farlow, a famous American botanist of Harvard University whose main work was working with algae plants, the favorite food of this slender catfish.[2] There are currently 30 recognized species in this genus:[2]"

        "description": " The genus Panaque contains a small number of small to medium-sized South American suckermouth armoured catfishes that are notable for being among the very few vertebrates that feed extensively on wood.[1]  In addition, algae and aufwuchs are an important part of the diet, and they use their rasping teeth to scrape this from rocks. These fish are also popular aquarium fish, where the sound of scraping as these fish forage for food is easily audible.[citation needed] Scobinancistrus and Panaqolus are sometimes considered to be subgenera of this genus.[2] There are currently seven recognized species in this genus:[3] The name Panaque is a Latinisation of a native Venezuelan name for these fish. It is pronounced \"pan ack\" in Britain and Europe, but often as \"pan aki\" or \"pan a kay\" in America. The Japanese call these fish \"pana koo ee\".[citation needed] Panaque are found in the Magdalena River, Orinoco River, Amazon River, Essequibo River, and Lake Maracaibo drainages.[5] All Panaque come from tropical South American and inhabit fast-flowing streams and rivers. They are weak swimmers but like other armoured catfish possess a strong sucker-like mouth with which they can hold on to submerged rocks and wood.[citation needed] Like other members of the armoured catfish family (Loricariidae), all Panaque have sturdy, armoured bodies covered in toughened plates of skin called scutes. These are not scales; like all catfish, Panaque lack scales. As well their armour, these catfish have very sturdy dorsal and pectoral fin spines. They use these defensively, either to wedge themselves into cracks from which predators cannot pull them, or else to prevent large predators from swallowing them. Another characteristic typical of the armoured catfish family is an iris. Most fish are unable to regulate the amount of light that enters the eye since they have irises that cannot change size. Both male and female Panaque develop bristles, known as odontodes, on the side of head immediately before and onto the pectoral fins.[citation needed] Unlike predatory catfish, these omnivorous catfish have very short barbels. These barbels can be seen in the photograph of mouth of a Panaque shown here; they are the short pointed structures on either side of a suckermouth. This sucker-like mouth allows them to attach to rocks and remain stationary with very little expenditure of energy.[citation needed] Along with the species of the Hypostomus cochliodon group (formerly the genus Cochliodon), it has been argued that Panaque are the only fish that can eat and digest wood.[5] Possible adaptations to consuming wood include spoon-shaped, scraper-like teeth and highly angled jaws to chisel wood.[5] Researchers have also identified symbiotic gut bacteria that may allow the fish to digest the wood they consume.[6] However, others have argued that Panaque do not in fact digest wood, and in fact take up very little energy from the wood they consume and actually lose weight when fed just wood.[7] Furthermore, their digestive tracts are no different from those of related catfish and they do not hold wood particles in the gut longer than other catfish, suggesting Panaque are not physically adapted to eating wood, and are in fact detritivores much like other Loricariidae.[7] In September 2010 scientists from the US National Science Foundation claimed to have discovered a new species of wood-eating catfish in the Alto Pur\u00fas National Park, Peru.[8] Several species of Panaque have become popular aquarium fish. The brightly coloured Panaque nigrolineatus is particularly popular and is known as the \"royal panaque\" or \"royal pleco\", monikers which reflect its comparative costliness and beauty over the common pleco. Royal plecos have a greyish-green base color against which thick, dark bluish-black stripes are set; their fins are edged with gold or cream, and their eyes are red. In captivity, royal plecos typically grow to around 30\u00a0centimeters in length.[9] A second species, Panaque cochliodon, is familiar to many aquarists as the \"blue-eyed pleco\". Though the blue-eyed pleco was widely traded in the late 1980s and early 1990s, it is now only rarely exported from its native Colombia.[10] It is also associated with the binomina Panaque suttonorum and P. suttoni, though Panaque suttonorum is a different fish which only comes from Venezuela. Blue-eyed plecos reach a similar size to royal plecos, but because many specimens are infected with a bacterium closely related to Rickettsia, mortality immediately after import can be high.[11] However, once they have settled in and begun feeding, they are no more difficult to keep than royal plecos.[citation needed] All Panaque catfish require much the same care in captivity. Panaque mainly demand a mixed diet including green algae, fresh vegetables such as carrots, courgettes, and spinach, but because they are argued to be xylophagous, many aquarists provide driftwood for them to graze upon, as well. The meaty foods enjoyed by other plecos are not required. Because they are relatively big for aquarium fish and produce an unusually large amount of waste, a high-capacity tank and filter are essential. Royal panaques tolerate a wider range of water chemistry than others\u2014they prefer somewhat soft, slightly acid water but they will tolerate hard, alkaline water.[citation needed] In terms of behavior, Panaque are peaceful and nocturnal bottom-dwellers which make good residents in community tanks. Like most of the other armored catfish, they are territorial, and groups should only be kept in very large tanks.[citation needed]"

        "description": " Pseudorinelepis genibarbis is a species of armored catfish native to Brazil, Peru, and Ecuador where it is found in the Amazon basin.[1] Pseudorinelepis is one of three genera contained in the tribe Rhinelepini, one of the tribes of Hypostominae.[2] Canthopomus and Monistiancistrus are synonyms of the genus Pseudorinelepis.[3] Previously, Pseudorinelepis was a genus of four species, but now the other three species are synonymous with P. genibarbis.[3] P. genibarbis is large and bulky and reaches a length of 35.6 centimetres (14.0\u00a0in) SL.[1] The armor plates along the side of the fish are thick, are keeled, and encase the whole body.[3] The adipose fin is not present.[3] Like other members of Rhinelepini, they do not have the omega iris that is typical in most species of Loricariids.[3] In Iquitos, Peru, it is known as carachama sin costilla, which actually means \"Loricariid without ribs\"; this refers to the trait that it shares with other Rhinelepini catfish that do not have ribs past the sixth vertebra.[3] This species is highly variable in coloration. P. genibarbis may be completely dark brown to black, mottled with tan to dark brown background and black streaks, or light tan with large, sparse spots located at base of lateral plates, fin membranes, and abdomen.[3] Males have longer odontodes on the cheek that are denser and more numerous than in females. It has been suggested that breeding males may also have orange on the cheeks and dorsal and caudal fin spines, although this may be restricted to fish from the Branco River.[3] P. genibarbis is found in small, sluggish streams, floodplain lakes, and large rivers.[3] Water quality measurements showed that the water tended to be low in oxygen, but neutral (pH\u00a07.0).[1] P. genibarbis is able to swallow air, like many other Loricariids. However, this species is not an obligate air-breather.[1] When disturbed, it is able to swallow air to become neutrally buoyant and swim in the water column.[1] This species is an armored catfish which, since the 1990s, has started to be offered quite regularly as an aquarium fish under the name \"Pineapple Pleco\".[citation needed] The term \"pleco\" here is of course a popular generalisation, as taxonomy has never placed this fish in the former genus Plecostomus. The armour is also pleasantly spiked along the sides of the fish, which causes the pineapple resemblance celebrated in the commercial name of the species. Additionally, under the L-number system used by hobbyists, it as referred to as both L152 and L095. There is quite a degree of colour variation, which is probably the main reason for the confusion over species. Some males having orange cheeks, which is why \"orange cheek Pleco\" is another common name found in circulation.[4] This is not made any easier by the fact that the fish will gradually darken if left in a tank with a darker substrate and lighten when kept on a lighter substrate. These changes take some time (hours or days) to effect, they do not happen quickly, so there is no real \"chameleon\" effect here, but no doubt it is a useful survival mechanism.[citation needed] From the viewpoint of the aquarist the fish is peaceful, sociable with others of its own type, non-territorial and omnivorous. Unsurprisingly, therefore, they do well in soft water, although pH values of up to 7.5 are acceptable, and the temperature range may fluctuate gently between 23-27\u00a0\u00b0C (73.4-80.6\u00a0\u00b0F.[4] Spawning in captivity has not yet been reliably reported.[4] Sexual dimorphism is slight, being determined mainly by a more rounded body shape in the females, and orange \"cheeks\", this refers to the operculum, in the males. The fish will, unlike most hypostomines, feed on flake from the water surface, turning upside-down to do so.[citation needed] It is also able to augment water-dissolved oxygen with atmospheric oxygen, but does not need to do so, having fully functional gills, so when this fish does gulp it is a useful warning that the aeration in the tank is low.[1]"

P. pardalis has 11\u201313, while the H. plecostomus has only 5\u20138 dorsal rays. It is also commonly misindentified as P. disjunctivus and can be differentiated by its spotted patterning.[3] There is an albino color variation of this species, usually referred to as an \"Albino Plecostomus\".[4] The amelanistic form may also be sold as the \"chocolate pleco\".[5] The species is native to the Amazon River Basin of Brazil and Peru, preferring pH ranges of 7.0\u20137.5. It is a facultative air breather; although normally a bottom-dwelling fish, it has the ability to breathe air from the surface of the water during dry periods or when dissolved oxygen is too low. The Amazon sailfin catfish has been introduced to a number of countries outside its native range.[1] It is recorded in the Marikina River in the Philippines and known as the \"janitor fish\", where it has become a local pest and sold in bulk, in efforts to eliminate the fish.[6][7][8][9] In the United States, invasive populations of sailfin catfishes like the Amazon sailfin catfish have been observed to be ecologically detrimental, as they disrupt aquatic food chains, decrease the abundance of native aquatic species, and degrade aquatic plants or banks of waterbodies through burrowing and tunneling.[10]"

Although the name Hypostomus plecostomus is often used to refer to common plecostomus sold in aquarium shops, most are actually members of other genera.[3][1] Suckermouth catfish are of little or no value as a food fish, although they are at least occasionally consumed over their native range.[citation needed] A demand exists for them, however, as a bottom cleaner in the aquarium trade.[4] This species' native range is tropical northeastern South America; it naturally occurs in northeastern Brazil, the Guianas, and Trinidad and Tobago.[5] Confusingly, the name Hypostomus plecostomus (or Plecostomus plecostomus) has sometimes been incorrectly used for several more-or-less similar loricariid catfishes, both in the popular and scientific literature. For example, it has sometimes been suggested that it occurs in southern Central America, but this is an entirely separate species, Hemiancistrus aspidolepis (also known under another synonym, Hypostomus panamensis).[6][7] Some Loricariidae species have been widely introduced to several countries around the world and reported as H. plecostomus.[5] It is erroneous,[1] and the concerned species belong to the genus Pterygoplichthys (either P. pardalis,[8] P. disjunctivus,[9] P. anisitsi[10] or P. multiradiatus[11]). In the United States, a Pterygoplichthys species has been introduced to some regions in the South, most likely released by aquarists into the local waters. For example, they are present in a lake in the neighborhood of Hammock Trace Preserve in Melbourne, Florida. In Texas, reproducing populations occur in spring-influenced habitats of the San Antonio River (Bexar County), Comal Springs (Comal County), San Marcos River (Hays County), and San Felipe Creek (Val Verde County), as well as in drainage canals in the Rio Grande Valley and Houston.[12][13] The same identification issues have spread in the literature regarding the invasive catfishes in Taiwan, with H. plecostomus being one of the numerous names used to designate the species: DNA studies showed the alien fishes were actually P. pardalis and P. disjunctivus (that hybridise extensively).[14] H. plecostomus prefer to live in water between 72 and 86 degrees Fahrenheit (~22.2 to 30 degrees Celsius), with a pH between 6.5 and 7.5.[15] Hypostomus plecostomus is named for its sucker-like mouth, which allows it to adhere to a surface, as well as to hold and rasp at food, including newly hatched and baby golden apple snails as well as Malaysian trumpet snails.[16] This omnivorous species also feeds on algae, aquatic plants, and small crustaceans.[17][citation needed] Hypostomus plecostomus is one of many species of fish that is able to breathe air. Hypostomus plecostomus relies on its gills for respiration in normal and slightly hypoxic water, and the less oxygen present in the water, the more frequently it surfaces to breathe air.[18] The air is taken to the stomach where the oxygen is absorbed, and the air can be kept in the stomach to increase buoyancy, which may help it to feed on vegetation.[19] H. plecostomus is one of a number of species commonly referred to as \"plecostomus\" or \"common pleco\" by aquarists.  These fish are sold when they are young and small, but in the wild, they can grow to be a maximum size of 50 centimetres (20\u00a0in).[20] In captivity, however, a full-grown Hypostomus plecostomus only reaches 15 inches (38\u00a0cm) on average, which could be explained by the subpar oxygen levels in most home aquaria and other practices of bad fish husbandry.[21] In the aquarium trade, this dark-colored, bottom-feeding, nocturnal catfish is often purchased for its ability to clean algae from fish tanks but also contributes a lot of waste to the nitrogen cycle. They are difficult for other fish to harass, both due to the semi-aggressive nature of the fish as well as its thick armor.[22] In Bangladesh, the species, among some other suckermouth catfishes has become invasive. The government is currently on its way to impose a ban on the farming, hatchling production, breeding, marketing and trading of the fish.[23] It has also raised serious concern in India and Sri Lanka.[24] A large variety of common names is used to describe H. plecostomus, where plecostomus and the shortened \"pleco\" are interchangeable in all common names. The names include: The species' scientific name, Hypostomus plecostomus, is derived from the Latin hypo (meaning \"under\"), stoma (meaning \"mouth\"), and pleco (meaning \"pleated\").[citation needed] Many of the common names used to identify Hypostomus plecostomus are also used for other species, which augments the confusion surrounding H. plecostomus and other Loricariidae such as H. punctatus, Pterygoplichthys multiradiatus and P. pardalis. In 2012, Weber, Covain, and Fisch-Muller showed the type series of Carl Linnaeus was heterogenous and comprised two species: H. plecostomus (for which the authors designate a lectotype) and H. watwata.[1]"

        "description": " Pterygoplichthys gibbiceps[1]  is a species of armored catfish native to Brazil, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela where it is found in the Orinoco and Amazon basins. Pterygoplichthys gibbiceps shows all the characteristic features of its genus\u2014a large dorsal fin with more than nine rays, prominent nasal flares and a prominent hump or crest anterior to the dorsal fin as well as a substantial base to the dorsal fin. Adult fish easily attain a length of 50.0 centimetres (19.7\u00a0in) TL and can live for more than 20 years. A typical plec shape is shown, patternation consists of primarily irregular largish brown spots on a yellowish backgroung giving a honeycombed like appearance, additional pattern features common to related species may be visible on close inspection. As this fish grows the spots get smaller. Like most plecs this species is primarily herbivorous though will eat dead animals. In the wild these fish are found in shoals in sluggish rivers of the Amazon and Orinoco river systems, they also occupy flooded land during the wet season. During the dry season P. gibbiceps will aestivate in burrows around 1 metre long dug into mud banks along the length of a river, egg rearing is also presumed to take place in burrow. The species name comes from the Latin gibbus\u2014hump, and caput\u2014head, a reference to the centrally located ridge. Common names include 'gibbys', leopard sailfin catfish and clown plecs\u2014the juveniles have a comical appearance due to the large and obvious spots. Ancistrus gibbiceps and Glyptoperichthys gibbiceps are synonyms of P. gibbiceps.\nThe fish has recently been caught from river Ganges, Banaras and is suspected to be yet another entrant to Invasive exotic list of fish in India. This fish is extremely popular in the aquarium, due to its unusual appearance and its ability to eat algae; the bane of all aquarists. This and other related species are bred in ponds in tropical regions for the aquarium trade. In general P. gibbiceps is peaceful towards other fish though territorial disputes arise with other plecos and fish of a similar or larger size. Though not nocturnal they are more active at night and will spend daylight hours 'hiding' in a secluded location. As the fish grows big (up to 60.96\u00a0cm in the aquarium) a large tank with good filtration is required, in general these fish are tolerant to a wide range of freshwater conditions though prefer well aerated water. The fish will 'gulp' surface air in poorly oxygenated water. A lesser-known trait is its mild camouflage ability, where it can lighten or darken its scales in a tiger-stripe pattern. It may reflect its mood or comfortability with the water parameters.[2][3] Pterygoplichthys gibbiceps is an omnivore. They can be fed with vegetables such as nettles, lettuce, spinach or carrots. Their diet can include meat; such as earthworms, blood worms or chopped shrimps.  They will also eat prepared foods from a pet shop, especially sinking algae wafers. The best way to breed Pterygoplichthys gibbiceps is to feed them with wide spectrum of food. With a good diet, they will grow quickly (up to 30 centimetres in one year). Adult Pterygoplichthys gibbiceps  may eat many aquarium plants. It can be almost impossible to differentiate males from females. Males in a group can be determined as they may become more territorial. Reproduction involves females laying roes into caves or hollows of roots. There is a high rate of mortality until the spawn are five centimeters long. The reason for this is unknown."

        "description": " The zebra pleco (Hypancistrus zebra) is a species of catfish endemic to a small section of the Rio Xingu in Brazil. It occurs in the big bend area of the river, downstream from the town of Altamira, Para. It was first described in 1991.[3] It gets its name from its black and white stripes, resembling the colouration of a zebra. This species grows to a length of 6.4 centimetres (2.5\u00a0in) SL.[3] This species was exported from Brazil in 1987 for sale as aquarium fish. However, currently, the Brazilian government bans the export of certain fish species, including H. zebra. H. zebra is threatened by the Belo Monte Dam in the Xingu river which has caused a severe reduction of the water flow of the entire known distribution range of the species. Due to this, the species has been classified as critically endangered and may soon become extinct in the wild. It is subject to several captive breeding programs. It is commercially bred in captivity for the aquarium trade. Mature males have a wider head and longer interopercular spines than females. After spawning, the males will guard the eggs. The fry swim after seven days and absorb the yolk sac in two weeks.[4] The minimum tank size for the species is said to be a minimum of 30 gallons (approximately 115 liters).\u00a0Maintaining water parameters at certain levels is also of importance when keeping them in an aquarium. The ideal water temperature for their tank is about 79\u201388\u00a0\u00b0F (26\u201331\u00a0\u00b0C). Reasonable water acidity levels are 6.5 pH to 7.0 pH with the water hardness ranging between 2 and 6 dKH.[5] Hypancistrus zebra can be referred to using the L-numbering convention often applied to Loricariidae, although, unlike most loricariids, H. zebra has two associated L-numbers: L-046 and L-098 both refer to the species. H. zebra is a predator and requires a high protein diet, typically including small invertebrates such as insect larvae. When in captivity, the species is often fed fresh or frozen bloodworms, brine shrimp and algae wafers. Occasionally, the species may be fed vegetables such as lettuce, cucumber, and squash.[5] This species should not be kept in the typical community aquarium, or with discus, despite advice to the contrary. These catfish thrive in biotopes with small dither fish which do not compete with H. zebra for food. The tank should mimic their natural environment with a substrate of small smooth gravel and pebbles with smooth boulders, cobbles and rocks forming caves and crevices.[6] The water must be highly oxygenated with a strong flow and surface agitation. It is an expensive species because it can only be collected or reproduced in small numbers. It is a simple fish to keep but it needs clean, warm water and a fast-moving current. They are unlikely to survive in still water or a dirty environment.[4] It is nocturnal, moderately territorial, and prefers plenty of hiding places.[4] In 2004, the zebra pleco was added to the IBAMA list of endangered species and exporting it from Brazil was made illegal. However, this law is only present in Brazil and black market fish traders smuggle them out of Brazil to then sell in other countries (primarily Colombia). Similarly to other Hypancistrus species, the male will trap the female in a cave where she will lay her eggs for the male to fertilise. This is usually done at around a pH of 6.5-7.2 and a water temp of 27\u00b0. This process can take between 1 and 5 days depending on the experience the female has in motherhood. The male will often bite the female to keep her in the cave, which is a natural behaviour for the species. Once the eggs are fertilised, the female will leave, although the male will guard the eggs until they hatch and may even stay to see them develop into fry. Once born, the fry will have a yolk sack attached to their underbelly, which is typically gone in a few days.[7] The species is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that international trade (including in captive bred specimens) is regulated by the CITES permitting system.[2]"

        "description": " Pterygoplichthys multiradiatus is one of several tropical fish commonly known as Orinoco sailfin catfish, plecostomus (or plecos). It belongs to the armored catfish family (Loricariidae). Named for its sail-like dorsal fin, the part of its scientific name multiradiatus means \"many-rayed\" and refers to the rays of the dorsal fin. P. multiradiatus is one of a number of species commonly referred to as the common pleco by aquarists.[1] Other scientific names that were used (as synonyms) for P. multiradiatus include Hypostomus multiradiatus, Ancistrus multiradiatus, and Liposarcus multiradiatus. P. multiradiatus is sometimes confused with Pterygoplichthys pardalis, which is a different species of pleco. P. multiradiatus goes by a number of common names. It can be called the \"long-fin armored catfish\" in Hawaii, \"sailfin catfish\", \"sailfish catfish\", \"many-rayed (multiradiatus) pleco\" or \"radiated ptero\" in the United States, \u591a\u8f3b\u7ffc\u7532\u9bf0 in Mandarin Chinese.\nP. multiradiatus is mottled brown/black and inhabits freshwater streams and lakes and in weedy, mud-bottomed canals in its native habitat: the Orinoco River basin in Venezuela. Its geographic distribution is 10\u00b0N - 1\u00b0N, 68\u00b0W - 61\u00b0W. This tropical, nocturnal bottom-dweller likes warm water at the temperature range of 23\u201327\u00a0\u00b0C, pH range: 6.5\u20137.8, and dH range: 4\u201320. P. multiradiatus browses on substrate, mainly feeding on benthic algae and aquatic weeds, but will also take worms, insect larvae and other bottom-dwelling invertebrates as food. One of the large plecos (growing to a maximum of 50.0 centimetres (19.7\u00a0in) TL), this species likes solitude, is relatively peaceful as an aquarium fish and does well with cichlids and other big fish, and should be kept in large tanks only and with plenty of rocks and driftwood in which to hide. Like many other plecos, it is very important in the aquarium trade. P. multiradiatus has been introduced to Taiwan,[2] Puerto Rico,[3] Florida, Hawaii, Texas, India, and Mexico,[4] most likely as the result of escapes or releases from aquarium fish farms. This species is firmly established in these and other locations, where it is regarded as a harmful invasive species being relatively inedible to people and predators, causing damage to fishing gear, competing and harming against native species and disrupting environments by its burrowing activities.[4] In this context its relative, Hypostomus plecostomus, has also been similarly implicated though it seems likely that in Asia, both or related species are implicated."

The zebra oto was described in 2004 from a tributary of the R\u00edo Ucayali in Peru.[2] Its closest relatives appear to be O. huaorani, O. bororo, O. mariae, and O. mura, as well as the more recently described species O. batmani.[3] This fish is found in Peru in the Ucayali River and possibly Mara\u00f1\u00f3n River as well. These fish are found in mid-sized creeks with clear water. It may also be found in small ponds.[1] They associate with marginal vegetation.[2] The zebra oto has a general body-shape like other Otocinclus species. They are small, have a suckermouth, and have armor on their bodies. The zebra oto can be distinguished from all other members of this genus by its vertical stripe-like blotches and its complete lateral line. The zebra oto has the highest number of teeth of any species of Otocinclus. The W mark on its caudal fin distinguishes this fish from all others except for O. batmani. The zebra oto reaches about 4.4\u00a0cm (1.7\u00a0in) in SL, though the males are smaller.[2] The zebra oto is listed as endangered by the IUCN Red List due to its limited range and overexploitation for the aquarium trade. Additionally, it is not protected in any part of its range, nor is it listed on CITES. The species has a decreasing population trend in the wild.[1] The zebra oto has been for sale in the aquarium trade since the early 1990s. It has been popular since at least 2000.[2] They are an occasionally seen species, and are bred in Asia in good numbers.[4]"

By numbering systems such as the L-number system, this fish may also be known as L104, L162, or LDA22.[1] This fish is endemic to Venezuela where it is found in the tannic Apur\u00e9 and Caron\u00ed River basins.[2] Their natural environment is driftwood tangles near riverbanks.[1] This species is a small loricariid. It reaches a length of 8.8 centimetres (3.5\u00a0in) SL.[2] This species has a striped pattern. However, this colouration may change with age. There are specimens with straight bars, but there are also specimens with a broken or wavy pattern. The wavy pattern form is found in the actual Orinoco and its tributaries in Bolivar State, Venezuela, while the \"normal\" patterned P. maccus comes from further north and west (Cojedes, Portuguesa, Guarico, and Apure States) in the Llanos where the drainages run into the Apure River.[1] Panaqolus maccus is one of the most common species of small, striped loricariids available in the fishkeeping hobby. This species adapts well to aquarium life.[1] They are not too difficult to spawn.[1] It should always be provided with enough driftwood in the tank, as it is a wood-eating fish. However fresh vegetables, spirulina and frozen foods such as bloodworms are recommended to be given as well from time to time. They are very peaceful fish suited for the average community tank. They are a hardy species of catfish and can tolerate various water parameters but prefer softer, more acidic water. Good filtration is needed because of the large amounts of waste they produce, caused by their wood-based diet. It is suited for tanks starting from 15 gallons.[1] It is difficult to successfully breed these fish in captivity. The tank setting and water parameters must be as near to their native habitat as possible. Seasonal changes can be simulated by adjusting the pH and temperature of the water. Soft driftwoods and cave formations give ample hiding places for the females to feel comfortable, and they may deposit eggs at some point.[3]"

        "description": " The redtail catfish, Phractocephalus hemioliopterus, is a pimelodid (long-whiskered) catfish. In Venezuela, it is known as cajaro, in Guyana, it is known as a banana catfish, and in Brazil, it is known as pirarara,[2] stemming from the Tupi language words pir\u00e1 and arara.[3] It is the only extant species of the genus Phractocephalus. This fish is common in the aquarium trade, although its massive adult size makes it unsuitable for all but the largest aquariums.[4] They feed on fish, crustaceans and fallen fruits.[5] They are not evaluated by IUCN. Although the redtail catfish is the only living representative of this genus, there are other members that date back to the upper Miocene, and are only known from fossil remains. P.\u00a0nassi was described in 2003, from the Urumaco Formation at Urumaco, Venezuela. Another fossil species, P.\u00a0acreornatus, is known from the Solim\u00f5es Formation, Acre, Brazil.[1][2] This genus has a minimum age of about 13.5\u00a0million years.[2] Phractocephalus hemioliopterus can reach about 1.8\u00a0m (5\u00a0ft 11\u00a0in) in length, and about 80\u00a0kg (180\u00a0lb) in weight.[6] However, this is exceptionally rare, and most do not approach this size. They average 3\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in\u00a0\u2013 4\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in; 1.1\u20131.4\u00a0m in length. These colorful large catfishes have a brownish back, with yellow sides, and characteristic orange-red dorsal fin and caudal fin (hence the common name). Sometimes the dorsal, pelvic and anal fins are also red. They have a broad head with long whiskers, dark black body and white underneath that extends from the mouth to the caudal fin. It has a pair of barbels on the upper jaw, and two pairs on the lower jaw. Their whiskers are sensitive and have chemical reception cells which are used as the sense of smell. They breed using external fertilization after laying their eggs. They communicate by making a clicking sound to warn off potential dangers.[5] The redtail catfish is native to the Amazon, Orinoco, and Essequibo river basins of South America, in Ecuador, Venezuela, Guyana, Colombia, Peru, Suriname, Bolivia, and Brazil.[2] It is found only in fresh water, and inhabits larger rivers, streams, and lakes.[7][4] They eat during the evening and night and stay motionless during the day. They are bottom-dwellers and move about quite slowly. Red-tailed catfish are territorial fish.[5] Redtail catfish is also an invasive species in Malaysia; they are now found mostly in the Perak River and Pahang River.[citation needed] Due to the potential large size of this species, redtail catfish are considered a game fish by anglers. The current IGFA world record for weight belongs to the Brazilian Gilberto Fernandes with 56\u00a0kg (123\u00a0lb 7\u00a0oz).[8] It is said that the natives do not eat the meat of the redtail catfish because it is black in coloration.[9] In Thailand, it is an alien species that has been introduced by humans, like the common pleco, zebra tilapia, and alligator gar.[10]\nIn some places, it is feared because it has been believed to be the cause of the mysterious drownings of many of the passengers aboard the passenger ship Sobral Santos II when it sank. The redtail catfish is an extremely popular fish in Amazonian-themed exhibits at public aquaria, where they are often housed with other large fish, such as Colossoma macropomum or pacu, and other large catfish. Juveniles are often available as aquarium fish, despite their eventual large size. In an aquarium where they may be well-fed, these fish can grow quite rapidly,[9] and require tanks of at least 10,000\u00a0L (2,600\u00a0US\u00a0gal) when fully mature.[4] Weekly feeding is appropriate for this catfish; overfeeding is a common cause of death in this species.[11] It feeds heavily on live and dead fishes and other meat. Even as a juvenile of only a few inches in length, they are able to swallow many of the more common aquarium fish (such as tetras or guppies), and it is only appropriate to house this fish with other species of relatively large size. Redtail catfish also have a habit of swallowing inedible objects in the aquarium. Though these are often regurgitated, both the swallowing and the regurgitation can present a problem for the fish, and these objects are best kept out of the aquarium.[11] The redtail catfish has been hybridized with other fish, such as the Pseudoplatystoma or Tiger Shovelnose Catfish, through the use of hormones, in attempts to create a viable food fish: the Tiger Redtail Catfish. These hybrid fish sometimes make it into the aquarium hobby under a variety of common names.[11]"

Pictus catfish are sometimes mislabeled as Angelicus cats in the aquarium trade, but the latter name actually refers to an unrelated  African catfish, the mochokid Synodontis angelica.[1] Pimelodus pictus should not be confused with Leiarius pictus, a much larger (60\u00a0cm) pimelodid. Pimelodus pictus, like other members of the Pimelodidae, are known for having extremely long barbels. These can extend all the way to the caudal fin. The fish are silver-colored with black spots and stripes. They have sharp spines on their dorsal and pectoral fins, which makes shipping a difficult task, since the spines can pierce plastic bags and get caught in nets. There is relatively little sexual dimorphism, with females being slightly larger than males.[2] Like many catfish, P.\u00a0pictus has a downturned mouth and a forked tail.[3] These fish are active swimmers and, like many catfish, nocturnal bottom feeders.[1] Two forms are known; a large-spotted form and a small-spotted form. Of the two, only the large-spotted form is commonly seen in the aquarium trade; it does not grow as large as the small-spotted form.[3] In captivity, these fish prefer soft water and are omnivorous; pictus cats eat bloodworms, beef heart, insects, vegetables, and prepared fish foods. They will also eat very small fish such as neon tetras, depending on the size of the catfish. Despite this, they are generally non-aggressive and will not harm fish too large for them to eat. A larger tank is required as these fish are agile and fast swimmers. They are also non-territorial and can be kept with other P. pictus. Besides the mildly venomous sting imparted by the dorsal spine, they are generally harmless to humans. In the wild, Pimelodus pictus has an estimated average trophic level of 3.19.[4]"

They become sexually mature at 56\u00a0cm (22\u00a0in), males at 45\u00a0cm (18\u00a0in)[3] and this species reaches a maximum length of 90\u00a0cm (35\u00a0in) TL.[1] Fecundity seems to be estimated at 8 million eggs per kg,[4] but was recently measured in aquaculture at a lower, and more likely number of 150,000 eggs laid per kg.[3] According to Riehl and Haensch, five subspecies have been described:[5] However, Buitrago\u2013Su\u00e1rez and Burr place P. f. brevifile, P. f. intermedium, and P. f. nigricans, in the synonymy of P. punctifer. P. f. reticulatum is elevated as another distinct species P. reticulatum.[1] Previously, all subspecies except P. f. reticulatum were considered synonyms of P. fasciatum.[2] The species is of interest for aquaculture for food production (and indirectly as conservation measure because it may lower the fishing pressure on wild population), as well as for production of fish.\nMaturation in earthen tanks of fish caught in the wild is not problematic, since manipulation of fish during fishing and transportation is well done.\nReproduction may be obtained with two injections of Ovaprim\u00ae in 24 hours (10% and 90% of the recommended dosis, respectively), ovulation occurs after around 8 hr at 27\u00a0\u00b0C.[3] Incubation of eggs is carried out in \"Zug\" jars and hatching occurs 24 hours after fertilization at 26,5\u00a0\u00b0C. Vitelus resorption takes 3 days but larvae start feeding 2 days after hatching, and may start active cannibalism at this moment. Feeding may start 48 hours post-hatching with freshly hatched artemia nauplii, seven times a day. Larvae must be kept in the dark in order to maximize uniform distribution of larvae in the tanks and therefore food availability.[6] After 15 days, food may be completed and then replaced gradually with ground mammalian liver. After 20 days post hatching, fingerling may be fed high quality pelleted food adapted to their size.  This Pimelodidae-related article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it."

        "description": " Synodontis multipunctatus, also known as the cuckoo catfish, cuckoo squeaker, or multipunk, is a small catfish from Lake Tanganyika, one of the lakes in the Great Rift Valley system in Africa. It is a brood parasite upon mouthbrooding cichlids.  This species grows to a length of 27.5 centimetres (10.8\u00a0in) TL.  This species is a minor component of local commercial fisheries.[2] Synodontis multipunctatus is one of a number of species of upside-down catfish in Lake Tanganyika, which is more famous for its cichlids. It gathers in large schools at depths of about 40 metres (130\u00a0ft) in the lake. S. multipunctatus is notable for its breeding behaviour - it is a brood parasite, similar to the cuckoo from which it takes its common name. Lake Tanganyika is home to a number of mouthbrooding cichlids, which care for their eggs and young by carrying them in their mouth. S. multipunctatus uses these, particularly Ctenochromis horei and Simochromis babaulti, as unwitting caretakers for their children. The smell of spawning cichlids excites S. multipunctatus into spawning, and as the cichlids lay their eggs the catfish will quickly slip in and eat the eggs before they can be collected by the mother. While doing so they also release and fertilise their own eggs. The female cichlid will hastily attempt to scoop up her eggs and, in doing so, will also collect eggs from S. multipunctatus. These eggs will then hatch inside the unwilling adoptive mother's mouth, and proceed to eat the cichlid eggs present before being released by the cichlid. This technique removes the burden of parental care from the S. multipunctatus, and allows them to breed again sooner. Synodontis multipunctatus are a popular addition to cichlid aquariums. They grow to about 15 centimetres (5.9\u00a0in), and can be bred in captivity provided suitable hosts are present. Some aquarists have had success with host cichlids from Lake Malawi and Lake Victoria as well as those from Lake Tanganyika.[3] They can be very aggressive and territorial towards other Synodontis species, they should be kept in groups over 3 to avoid competition between two, and proper cover and cave-like structures should be provided. They seem to be active in the day as much as the night and can prove quite lively. If kept in larger groups territorial issues are less likely.

        "description": " Synodontis petricola, known as the cuckoo catfish,[2] or the pygmy leopard catfish,[3] is a species of upside-down catfish endemic to Burundi, Zambia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Tanzania where it is only known from Lake Tanganyika.[2][4]  It was first described by Belgian ichthyologist Hubert Matthes in 1959.[4]  The species name \"petricola\" is derived from a combination of the Latin petra, meaning stone or rock, and the Latin cola, meaning inhabitant.  This refers to the rocky environment where this species is found.[3] Like all members of the genus Synodontis, S. petricola has a strong, bony head capsule that extends back as far as the first spine of the dorsal fin.[5] The head is about 3\u204410 of the standard length of the fish.[4] The head contains a distinct narrow, bony external protrusion called a humeral process.[3] The shape and size of the humeral process helps to identify the species. In S. petricola, the humeral process is triangular, rough, and is covered in many small, thin papillae.[4] The bottom edge has a poorly-defined ridge on the bottom edge, and the top edge is convex.[4] The humeral process ends in a sharp point.[4] It is about 1\u20442 of the length of the head.[4] The diameter of the eye is about 1\u20449 of the length of the head.[4] The fish has three pairs of barbels. The maxillary barbels are on located on the upper jaw, and two pairs of mandibular barbels are on the lower jaw. The maxillary barbel has a narrow membrane attached near the base and is straight without any branches.[4] It extends at least as far as the base of the pectoral spine, about 3\u20444 of the length of the head.[4] The outer pair of mandibular barbels extends just past the start of the pectoral girdle, about 1\u20442 of the length of the head,[4] and contains four to seven simple branches, usually without any secondary branches.[4] The inner pair of mandibular barbels is about 1\u20443 to 2\u20443 as long as the outer pair, about 1\u20444 of the length of the head,[4] with four to six branches, with many secondary branches present.[4] The skin of S. petricola has a large number of tiny vertical skin folds. The exact purpose of the skin folds is not known, but is a characteristic of the species of Syndontis that are endemic to Lake Tanganyika.[4] External granular papilla are present on the head, but not the body.[4] The front edges of the dorsal fins and the pectoral fins of Syntontis species are hardened into stiff spines.[3] In S. petricola, the spine of the dorsal fin is long, about 3\u20444 as long as the head,[4] is slightly curved, is smooth on the front and with fine serrations the back, and ends with short, white filament.[4] The remaining portion of the dorsal fin is made up of seven dark branching rays.[4] The spine of the pectoral fin is slightly curved, roughly as long as the dorsal fin spine, with large serrations on the back side.[4] The pectoral spine ends in short, white filament.[4] The rest of the pectoral fins are made up of eight to nine branching rays.[4] The adipose fin is large, does not contain any rays, and has a convex shape.[4] The pelvic fin contains one unbranched and six branched rays.[4] The front edge of the pelvic fin is vertically aligned midway between with the back edge of the dorsal fin and the front edge of the adipose fin.[4] The anal fin contains three to four unbranched and seven to nine branched rays; it is vertically aligned with the center of the adipose fin.[4] The tail, or caudal fin, is forked, with rounded lobes, and contains eight rays on the upper lobe, nine rays on the lower lobe.[4] The mouth of the fish faces downward and has wide lips that contain papilla.[4] All members of Syndontis have a structure called a premaxillary toothpad, which is located on the very front of the upper jaw of the mouth. This structure contains several rows of short, chisel-shaped teeth. In some species, this toothpad is made up of a large patch with several rows in a large cluster. In other species of Syndontis, this toothpad is clearly divided into two separate groups, separated by a thin band of skin that divides the toothpad.[4] This character is used as a method of differentiating between to different but similar species of Syndontis.[4] In S. petricola, the toothpad is interrupted, or clearly divided between the groups of teeth on the toothpad.[4] On the lower jaw, or mandible, the teeth of Syndontis are attached to flexible, stalk-like structures and described as \"s-shaped\" or \"hooked\".[3][5] The number of teeth on the mandible is used to differentiate between species; in S. petricola, there are 31 to 50 teeth on the mandible, arranged in a six short rows.[4] Some of the species of Synodontis have an opening or series of openings called the axillary pore. It is located on the side of the body below the humeral process and before the pectoral fin spine. The exact function of the port is not known to scientists, although its presence has been observed in seven other catfish genera. Fish in the genus Acrochordonichthys have been observed to secrete a mucus with toxic properties from their axillary pore, but there is no scientific consensus as to the exact purpose of the secretion or the pore.[4] S. petricola has a small axillary pore just below the humeral process.[4] The back of the fish is yellowish to copper-brown and is covered with large, irregularly-shaped black spots.[4]  In juveniles, these spots can appear larger and sometimes intersect.[4] The underside of the fish is lighter, with small, irregularly shaped spots.  Most of the species of Synodontis of Lake Tanganyika have a recognizable pattern consisting of dark triangles at the bases of all of the rayed fins, present in S. petricola, and the back edges of the fins are white in color.[4] The caudal fin has a black bar that runs from the base of each lobe to the top of the fin.[4] The barbels are white.[4] The maximum standard length of all known specimens is 11.5 centimetres (4.5\u00a0in) and a total length of 13.5 centimetres (5.3\u00a0in).[2][4] In general in Synodontis species, females tend to be slightly larger than males of the same age.[6] In the wild, the species is endemic to Lake Tanganyika, which has a temperature range of 23 to 26\u00a0\u00b0C (73 to 79\u00a0\u00b0F), and an approximate pH of 8.5 \u2013 9, and dH range of 4-15.[7] It inhabits rocky shorelines in the littoral zone, to a maximum depth of 30 metres (98\u00a0ft).[4] The reproductive habits of most of the species of Synodontis are not known, beyond some instances of obtaining egg counts from gravid females.[4] Spawning likely occurs during the flooding season between July and October, and pairs swim in unison during spawning.[8] Juveniles appear to be carnivorous, feeding on water mites, seed shrimp, and insect larvae. Adults feed on algae scraped from rocks as well as small invertebrates.[4] The growth rate is rapid in the first year, then slows down as the fish age.[6] The pygmy leopard catfish practices brood parasitism. It lives among rock piles frequented by various species of mauna: small African cichlids. Courtship behaviour culminates with the female sucking sperm from the male's cloaca. She brings the sperm through her digestive tract to her cloaca, where her eggs meet the sperm. She then rushes into the nest of a cichlid, devours the eggs, and deposits her own. The cichlids then raise the catfish as their own. Data related to Synodontis petricola at Wikispecies"

        "description": " Synodontis angelicus is a species of upside-down catfish commonly named polkadot squeaker, black clown catfish, whitespotted squeaker, pearl squeaker, or angel squeaker.[1][2]  This species is native to the Congo Basin in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of the Congo.  It was originally described in 1891 by Belgian ichthyologist Louise Schilthuis after its discovery in the Malebo Pool of the Congo River.[3]   The specific name \"angelicus\" means heavenly or divine, since juveniles of this species are remarkable for their bright coloring.[3] Adult specimens between 9 and 18 centimetres (3.5 and 7.1\u00a0in) are grey to dark violet, with reddish-yellow to bark brown-red blotches on the head, sides, adipose fin, and partly running together on the ventral surface.[3]   These blotches are evenly distributed and have sharp, distinct edges.[3]   The blotches may be edged with dark violet.  The fins are dark violet with brownish blotches and streaks.[3]   Juveniles between 4 and 9 centimetres (1.6 and 3.5\u00a0in) are strikingly colored, with white, round blotches on a red-violet background.[3] The first ray of the dorsal fin and the pectoral fins have a hardened first ray which is serrated.[2]   The caudal fin is deeply forked with an extension on the top lobe.[2][3]   It has short, cone-shaped teeth in the upper jaw.[2] In the lower jaw, the teeth are s-shaped and movable.[2] This species grows to a length of 25 centimetres (9.8\u00a0in) SL although specimens up to 55 centimetres (22\u00a0in) TL have been recorded in nature.[1] The species is commercially used as an aquarium species.[4]  The polka-dot African catfish is mostly nocturnal.[3] These catfish will excavate the substrate and may nibble plants. They eat smaller live foods and prepared foods. They prefer a water temperature of 24 to 28\u00a0\u00b0C (75 to 82\u00a0\u00b0F), a pH of 6.0\u20138.0 and a hardness of 5\u201319 dGH.[1] Data related to Synodontis angelicus at Wikispecies"

        "description": " Synodontis fascipinna Nichols & La Monte, 1953 Synodontis nigrita, known as the false upside down catfish,[2] is a species of upside-down catfish that occurs widely in northern Africa.[3]  It was first described by French zoologist Achille Valenciennes in 1840.  The type specimen is in the Mus\u00e9um National d' Histoire Naturelle de Paris.[4] Like all members of the genus Synodontis, S. nigrita has a strong, bony head capsule that extends back as far as the first spine of the dorsal fin.[5]  The head contains a distinct narrow, bony, external protrusion called a humeral process.[2] The shape and size of the humeral process helps to identify the species. In S. nigrita, the humeral process is as much longer than it is broad, with a ridge on the bottom edge, and with a pointed back end.[4] The fish has three pairs of barbels. The maxillary barbels are on located on the upper jaw, and two pairs of mandibular barbels are on the lower jaw. The maxillary barbel is long and straight without any branches, with a broad membrane at the base.[4] It extends to a length about 1 to 1+2\u20443 times the length of the head.[4] The outer pair of mandibular barbels is about twice the length of the inner pair, and both pairs have short, simple branches.[4] The front edges of the dorsal fins and the pectoral fins of Syntontis species are hardened into stiff spines.[2]  In S. nigrita, the spine of the dorsal fin is straight or slightly curved, 3\u20444 to 1 times the length of the head, smooth in the front and serrated on the back.[4] The remaining portion of the dorsal fin is made up of seven branching rays.[4] The spine of the pectoral fin about the same size as the dorsal spine, and serrated on both sides.[4] The adipose fin is 2+2\u20443 to 3 times as long as it is deep.[4] The anal fin contains four unbranched and eight to nine branched rays.[4] The tail, or caudal fin, is deeply forked, with the upper lobe slightly longer.[4] All members of Syndontis have a structure called a premaxillary toothpad, which is located on the very front of the upper jaw of the mouth. This structure contains several rows of short, chisel-shaped teeth.  In S. nigrita, the toothpad forms a short and broad band.[4]   On the lower jaw, or mandible, the teeth of Syndontis are attached to flexible, stalk-like structures and described as \"s-shaped\" or \"hooked\".[2][5] The number of teeth on the mandible is used to differentiate between species; in S. nigrita, there are about 30 to 35 teeth on the mandible.[4] The body color is brown or olive to blackish, with round black spots likely.  The fins are greyish to blackish; the caudal fin has black spots or black cross bars.  Juveniles are brown, with black spots.[4] The maximum total length of the species is 33.5 centimetres (13.2\u00a0in).[3]  Generally, females in the genus Synodontis tend to be slightly larger than males of the same age.[6] In the wild, the species has been found throughout northern Africa.  In central Africa, it has been recorded in the Ubangui River basin and the central Congo River basin.  In eastern Africa, it is found in Lake Albert and possibly Lake Kyoga.  In northern Africa, it is possibly present in Egypt.  In northeast Africa, it occurs in the White Nile from Khartoum into the Jebel and Ghazal River systems, as well as the Baro River.  In western Africa, the species is known from the Chad River basin, the Niger River basin, the Volta River, the Senegal River, the Gambia River, the Geba River, the Oueme River, and the Casamance River.[1]  The reproductive habits of most of the species of Synodontis are not known, beyond some instances of obtaining egg counts from gravid females.[7] Spawning likely occurs during the flooding season between July and October, and pairs swim in unison during spawning.[8]   As a whole, species of Synodontis are omnivores, consuming insect larvae, algae, gastropods, bivalves, sponges, crustaceans, and the eggs of other fishes.[7]  The growth rate is rapid in the first year, then slows down as the fish age.[6] Data related to Synodontis nigrita at Wikispecies"

These fish are adapted to spend most of their time upside-down. This is reflected in the fish's pigmentation \u2013 their bellies are darker than their backs, a form of countershading.[3] These fish have lighter colors on the top of their bodies and darker colors below used for camouflage. The lighter colors on the top of them make it harder for predators to see the fish when looking up toward the sky but only when the fish are swimming upside-down.[4] Synodontis nigriventris are mostly nocturnal, and feed on insects, crustaceans, and plant matter.[2] These fish lay eggs.[2] The young fish do not swim upside-down until they are about two months old.[5] Adults swim and rest upside down in the water. They swim faster when upside down, and are more likely to be upside down around objects or at the water bottom. The more objects around the fish, the more they tend to swim upside down.[4] When close to an object, the fish puts its ventral side closest to the object.[4] It rarely swims in the middle of the water, preferring to swim either at the bottom or at the surface.[6] By swimming upside down when it feeds,[7] it can readily catch prey at the surface from beneath.[4] The blotched upside-down catfish is well suited to aquariums because of its small size (typically 9 or 10\u00a0cm or less) and peaceful demeanor.[3] Data related to Synodontis nigriventris at Wikispecies"

Its distribution covers includes bodies of water from East Africa to West Africa. It generally lives in shallow waters with muddy bottoms.[1] This fish has a maximum size that sources say are between two and three feet. The giraffe-like pattern will fade with age to a two-tone mottled brown. Various subspecies have been described for this fish, indicating some geographical variation in coloration.[2] Eggs are scattered in a nest and guarded by the male. Dinotopterus cunningtoni takes advantage of the care and allows the male giraffe catfish to care for its eggs and young, an example of interspecific brood care.[1] The giraffe catfish is occasionally imported for the aquarium trade. Because of its large eventual size and its fast rate of growth, it is inappropriate for smaller aquaria. This fish will readily accept a variety of foods and is tolerant of a wide variety of water conditions. They will scavenge the aquarium looking for food, which could cause in the uprooting of plants.[2] This fish is also an important food fish in Africa.[2]"

It uses its power to defend itself and to capture prey. In Africa, it occurs in the Nile and tropical Africa (exclusive of Lake Victoria), Lake Turkana, Lake Chad and Senegal basins. Occurs among rock favors standing water. Active at night, feeding mainly on fish stunned by electric shocks. The electric organ, capable of discharging 300-400 V, is derived from pectoral muscle and surrounds almost the entire body. It is used both for prey capture and defense. This is an Old World catfish. It is reputed that Doctors in ancient Egypt used shocks from the Electric Catfish to reduce the pain of arthritis. This trait is still used today in some areas. It also has the earliest reference of them as hieroglyphics on the walls of ancient Egyptian tombs some 5,000 years ago.[citation needed] Malapterurus electricus is eaten as food in parts of Africa. Being a food fish, M. electricus is also encountered in the pet trade as an aquarium fish. The electric organs of Malapterurus have been used in studies of neuronal metabolism, axonal transport. In their natural habitat they form pairs and lay their eggs in excavated cavities or holes. The male takes the eggs into his mouth. There have been rumours that they are mouth brooders. It is also unknown how the fry is immune to the electric shocks by the parents. Malapterurus electricus is sometimes encountered in aquarium supply stores. It can reach a maximum length of over 1 meter (3\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in) in the wild, but has an average size of 12 inches (30\u00a0cm) in the aquarium. It is quite hardy and greedily accepts most foods, although some experimentation may be required to find the best food. The only other animals that are compatible with this species are snails, which they will ignore. A minimum aquarium size of 55 US gallons (210\u00a0L; 46\u00a0imp\u00a0gal) is required, with bogwood or pieces of PVC pipe. They are active burrowers and will often remove the gravel from under their favorite hiding spot. A minimum temperature of 75\u00a0\u00b0F (24\u00a0\u00b0C) is necessary.[citation needed] It is illegal to possess any species of electric catfish for personal or commercial use in Florida.[2]"

        "description": " Kryptopterus vitreolus, known in the aquarium trade traditionally as the glass catfish[1][2] and also as the ghost catfish or phantom catfish, is a small species of Asian glass catfish. It is commonly seen in the freshwater aquarium trade, but its taxonomy is confusing and was only fully resolved in 2013.[1] It is endemic to Thailand, and found in rivers south of the Isthmus of Kra that drain into the Gulf of Thailand and river basins in the Cardamom Mountains.[1]  There are also unconfirmed reports from Penang in Malaysia.[2] Until 1989, it was considered to be the same as the \"glass catfish\" Kryptopterus bicirrhis, a larger species infrequently seen in the aquarium trade.[1] Subsequently, the ghost catfish commonly seen in the aquarium trade was believed to be the same as K. minor, but in 2013 it was established that the aquarium specimens actually represented another species, which was described as K. vitreolus.[1] The true K. minor, which is restricted to Borneo, has rarely (if ever) entered the aquarium trade.[1] This is a transparent freshwater catfish with two long barbels. Standard lengths may range up to 8\u00a0cm (3.1\u00a0in), but usually only reach around 6.5\u00a0cm (2.6\u00a0in) in total length.[1] They are transparent because, like all catfish, they are scaleless, and catfish within the genus Kryptopterus lack body pigment. Most of their organs are located near the head; with a magnifying glass, their heart can be seen beating. When the light strikes the fish just right, it can create an iridescent rainbow color. During strong illness and after death, they turn milky white. The scientific species name vitreolus is derived from the Latin vitreus, which means glass.[1] Among described species of Kryptopterus, only two other species, K. minor and K. piperatus, have clearly transparent bodies and both these are largely \u2013 if not entirely \u2013 absent from the aquarium trade.[1] The body of others, including K. bicirrhis, are only somewhat translucent or opaque.[1] The aquarium trade in K. vitreolus generally relies on wild-caught specimens, and there are concerns that this may be unsustainable due to the volume and its limited range.[1] Unlike many other aquarium fish, it is not known to be bred at commercial facilities.[1] K. vitreolus reacts to electromagnetic fields owing to a protein encoded by Electromagnetic Perceptive Gene (EPG).[3]"

        "description": " Wallagonia leerii, also known as the Great Tapah, helicopter catfish, and formerly the striped wallago catfish is a species of catfish native to Southeast Asia. Its habitat ranges from the river drainages of Thailand through the Malayan peninsula to the islands of Sumatra and Borneo in Indonesia.[1] It can grow up to 2\u00a0m (6\u00a0ft 7\u00a0in) in length and weigh up to 150\u00a0kg (330\u00a0lb).[1] It has been used as food in Southeast Asia since ancient times.[2] Overfishing for its prized meat has caused the population to significantly decrease. Furthermore, the breeding migration pattern of this fish is especially vulnerable to damming, which has also decreased the wild population significantly. Until osteological research validated the genus Wallagonia in 2014, W. leerii was included in the genus Wallago.[1] The other two species of the genus Wallagonia, the Lesser tapah from the Mekong river basin and the Spotted tapah from the Kinabatangan river basin on Borneo, are currently considered as distinct species. There are, however, strong suspicions that these may in fact be subspecies of W. leerii, as the sole difference seems to lie in a slightly different coloration.[1] The Great Tapah is a large fish, commonly attaining lengths of 150 centimetres and a mass of up to 86 kilograms. The size of this fish however can easily exceed the aforementioned lengths.[3]  It is the second-largest catfish in its family and is only outsized by the wels, Giant pangasius and Mekong giant catfish. It has a short, rounded body and a long broad tail, the anal fin of the fish is about as long as the tail itself and it ends in a forked caudal fin. The pelvic fins of the fish are small, and there are no dorsal spines on it. The Great Tapah possesses a noticeable hump, atop sits its dorsal fin, which is small and almost elliptical. The head of this fish is long, and remarkably wide with a huge lower jaw that extends beyond its maxilla. The mouth of the catfish is inlaid with several rows of sharp teeth that enable it to grip prey. It is a piscivore, primarily feeding on small fish which are snatched mid-swimming and consumed whole. The Great Tapah faces a multitude of threats, as it is vulnerable to destructive fishing, competition with invasive species, destruction of suitable habitat, and dam construction that impact its lifecycle.[4] Splitting of species within the complex may give doubts to the true abundance of the species, meaning it could be far more restricted than once thought. In July, adults migrate downstream to flooded grasslands to spawn. At night, the eggs are spawned near the surface.[5]  This catfish-related article is a stub.

        "description": " The walking catfish  (Clarias batrachus) is a species of freshwater airbreathing catfish native to Southeast Asia. It is named for its ability to \"walk\" and wiggle across dry land, to find food or suitable environments. While it does not truly walk as most bipeds or quadrupeds do, it can use its pectoral fins to keep it upright as it makes a wiggling motion with snakelike movements to traverse land.[2] This fish normally lives in slow-moving and often stagnant waters in ponds, swamps, streams, and rivers, as well as in flooded rice paddies, or temporary pools that may dry up. When this happens, its \"walking\" skill allows the fish to move to other aquatic environments. Considerable taxonomic confusion surrounds this species and it has frequently been confused with other close relatives.[3][4] One main distinction between the walking catfish and the native North American ictalurid catfish with which it sometimes is confused, is that the walking catfish lacks an adipose fin.[5] It can survive 18 hours out of water. [6] The walking catfish has an elongated body shape and reaches almost 0.5\u00a0m (1.6\u00a0ft) in length and 1.2\u00a0kg (2.6\u00a0lb) in weight.[3] Often covered laterally in small white spots, the body is mainly coloured a gray or grayish brown.[5] This catfish has long-based dorsal and anal fins,[5] as well as several pairs of sensory barbels. The skin is scaleless, but covered with mucus, which protects the fish when it is out of water. This fish needs to be handled carefully when fishing it due to its embedded sting or thorn-like defensive mechanism hidden behind its fins (including the middle ones before the tail fin, similar to the majority of all catfishes). The walking catfish is a tropical species native to maritime Southeast Asia. The native range of true Clarias batrachus is confirmed only from the Indonesian island of Java, but three closely related and more widespread species frequently have often been confused with this species. These are C. magur of northeast India and Bangladesh, a likely undescribed species from Indochina, and another likely undescribed species from the Thai-Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, and Borneo.[3][4] Both of these undescribed species have been referred to as, Clarias aff. batrachus.[3] At present, the taxonomic position of the Philippines population (called hito or simply \"catfish\" by the locals) is unclear, and it also is unclear whether South Indian populations are C. magur or another species.[4] As a consequence, much information (behavioral, ecological, related to introduced populations, etc.) listed for C. batrachus, may be for the closely related species that have been confused with true C. batrachus.[4] True C. batrachus, C. magur and the two likely undescribed species are all kept in aquaculture.[4] Walking catfish thrive in stagnant, frequently hypoxic waters,[5] and often are found in muddy ponds, canals, ditches, and similar habitats. The species spends most of its time on, or right above, the bottom, with occasional trips to the surface to gulp air.[5] In the wild, this creature is omnivorous; it feeds on smaller fish, molluscs, and other invertebrates, as well as detritus and aquatic weeds. It is a voracious eater that consumes food supplies rapidly, so it is considered harmful when invasive.[7] Within Asia, this species has been introduced widely.[3] It has also been introduced outside its native range where it is considered an invasive species. It consumes the food supplies of native fish and preys on their young. It also is regarded as an invasive species because they can destroy fish farms. In the United States, it is established in Florida.[8] It is reported in California, Connecticut, Georgia, Massachusetts, and Nevada.  \nThe walking catfish was imported to Florida, reportedly from Thailand, in the early 1960s for the aquaculture trade.[5] The first introductions apparently occurred in the mid-1960s when adult fish imported as brood stock escaped, either from a fish farm in northeastern Broward County or from a truck transporting brood fish between Dade and Broward Counties. Additional introductions in Florida, supposedly purposeful releases, were made by fish farmers in the Tampa Bay area, Hillsborough County in late 1967 or early 1968, after the state banned the importation and possession of walking catfish. Aquarium releases likely are responsible for introductions in other states. Dill and Cordone (1997) reported this species has been sold by tropical fish dealers in California for some time. They also have been spotted occasionally in the Midwest. In Florida, walking catfish are known to have invaded aquaculture farms, entering ponds where they prey on agricultural fish stocks. In response, fish farmers have had to erect fences to protect ponds. Authorities have also created laws that ban possession of walking catfish. In 2017, Clarias spp. were recovered from the River Tonge, near Bolton, Northern England.[9] In Indonesia, it is commonly referred as lele, or when needing distinction; lele jawa or lele kampung, compared to lele dumbo or lele sangkuriang which refers to the introduced C. gariepinus. It is the main ingredient in several traditional dishes, such as pecel lele and mangut lele. In Thailand, Clarias aff. batrachus is known as pla duk dan (Thai: \u0e1b\u0e25\u0e32\u0e14\u0e38\u0e01\u0e14\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19). It is a common, inexpensive food item, prepared in a variety of ways. It often is offered by street vendors, especially grilled or fried.[10] This fish is also one of the most common freshwater catfish in the Philippines, which as aforementioned is known as hito in the local language. Despite this, current evidence of Clarias aff. batrachus populations from other regions of southeast Asia and India in relation towards C. batrachus have not been thoroughly studied.[clarification needed] A white variation with black patterns is commonly seen in the aquarium fish trade. However, this color variation also is prohibited where walking catfish are banned. Very well-rooted plants and large structures that provide some shade should be included in an aquarium with these fish. Any small tankmates will be eaten by this fish."

It has also been introduced to the Tigris River Basin in western Iran.[1] H. fossilis is found mainly in ponds, ditches, swamps, and marshes, but sometimes occurs in muddy rivers. It can tolerate slightly brackish water. It is omnivorous. This species breeds in confined waters during the monsoon, but can breed in ponds, derelict ponds, and ditches when sufficient rainwater accumulates. It is in great demand due to its alleged medicinal value.[2] The stinging catfish is able to deliver a painful sting to humans. Poison from a gland on its pectoral fin spine has been known to be extremely painful. This species grows to a total length of 30\u00a0cm (12\u00a0in), and is an important component of local commercial fisheries.  It is also farmed and found in the aquarium trade.[2]  This catfish-related article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it."

It is known as G\u00fcnther's catfish or yellow catfish.[2] It is also known as Manjakoori in its native range.[3] It is also known by a host of other names, such as bullseye catfish, golden red tail catfish and solar catfish.[4] H. brachysoma has a large head and a wide mouth. The eyes are large and can be seen from below the fish. There is a dorsal fin with a hard spine as well as an adipose fin.[5] There are four pairs of barbels, one nasal, one maxillary (sides of the mouth), and two mandibular (chin).[5] The body is yellowish with black shoulder spot surrounded by a lighter outline.[6]  This fish can reach a length of 45 centimetres (18\u00a0in) TL.[7] H. brachysoma is known from the Kerala Backwaters, Vembanad Lake, Chalakudy River, Nethravathi River of south Karnataka.[8] and the Uttara Kannada district of India.[5]  They occur in smooth flowing areas with much vegetation. H. brachysoma is found in smooth flowing areas with much vegetation. Periyar river in Kerala state is the best habitat but now they are commonly seen in the Chalakudy River due to the less disturbed habitats. The population genetic structure of this species has been studied extensively by using genetic markers.[9][10]  This species occupies lowland areas of rivers and backwaters with mud or sand substrate. It has also been recorded in deep pools and hill streams.[2]\nThe diet of H. brachysoma has been studied. It is an unspecialized feeder and eats a variety of meaty foods. Food items include crustaceans, molluscs, and fish. Adults may consume terrestrial insects and even frogs. Stomachs of these fish contain detritus which is indicative of its bottom-feeding habits.[3] This flexible diet is beneficial in its variable habitat, in which food availality is affected by monsoons.[3]  Feeding rate is known to increase during the breeding season in the months following the monsoon season.[3] Spawning occurs before the monsoons and finishes by the southwest monsoon in the summer.[2] H. brachysoma is an important food fish in India and is also sold in the aquarium trade. The IUCN considers H. brachysoma to be a vulnerable species, while other have considered it to be an endangered species.[11] Overexploitation, habitat alteration, pollution and related anthropogenic pressures on their natural habitats have considerably reduced populations of this species by 60\u201370% during the last few years.[3]"

        "description": " Helicophagus hypophthalmus Sauvage, 1878\nPangasius sutchi Fowler, 1937[3]\nPangasius hypophthalmus (Sauvage, 1878) The iridescent shark, iridescent shark catfish[4] (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus) is a species of shark catfish (family Pangasiidae) native to the rivers of Southeast Asia. Despite its name, it is not a shark. It is found in the Mekong basin as well as the Chao Phraya River, and is heavily cultivated for food there. The meat is often marketed under the common name swai (from Thai \u0e2a\u0e27\u0e32\u0e22). It has also been introduced into other river basins as a food source, and its striking appearance and iridescence have made it popular with fishkeeping hobbyists, among whom it is also known as the Siamese shark catfish or sutchi catfish.[5] The swai's omnivorous diet consists of crustaceans, other fish, and plant matter.[6] The fish is named for the glow or iridescence exhibited in juveniles, as well as the shark-like appearance of this and other shark catfish. Adults reach up to 130\u00a0cm (4.3\u00a0ft) in length and can weigh up to a maximum of 44\u00a0kg (97\u00a0lb). They have a shiny, iridescent color that gives these fish their name. However, large adults are uniformly grey. The fins are dark grey or black. Juveniles have a black stripe along the lateral line and a second black stripe below the lateral line.[6] Iridescent sharks originate from the large rivers Chao Phraya and Mekong in Asia, though they have been introduced into other rivers for aquaculture. They are a freshwater fish that natively live in a tropical climate and prefer water with a 6.5\u20137.5 pH, a water hardness of 2.0\u201329 dGH, and a temperature range of 22\u201326\u00a0\u00b0C (72\u201379\u00a0\u00b0F).[6] They can tolerate hypoxic conditions thanks to their swim bladder which can be used as an air-breathing organ.[7] They prefer large bodies of water similar to the deep waters of their native Mekong river basin. The iridescent shark is a migratory fish that in most regions moves upstream to spawn during the flood season while the waters are high and returns downstream to seek rearing habitats when the river water levels recede. The dates of the migrations vary depending on the river system. In the Mekong river basin, they migrate upstream in May to July and return downstream during September through December. South of the Khone Falls, upstream migration occurs in October to February, with its peak in November to December; here, it appears to be triggered by receding waters at the end of the flood season.[6] In August 2015, an environmental group in Santander, Colombia, confirmed that iridescent sharks had been found in one of the tributaries that feed into the Magdalena River, having been accidentally introduced from illegal farm fisheries in the area. The find has caused alarm amongst the scientific community and government officials, as the Magdalena river is home to over 200 native fish species, 35 of which are endangered.[8] Disruption to these sharks can come from many physical stressors, including but not limited to shear forces, rapid decompression, blade strike and turbulence. These can lead to and have led to an increase in the Injury and mortality rate of these sharks. This is a sad reality[citation needed] since these injured can be caused by hydropower developments which are being put into place to combat the global climate crisis that is being faced.[9]\nIridescent sharks are also introduced to other Southeast Asia countries for food, especially Peninsular Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and Myanmar. In Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia they are called ikan patin (which 'ikan' means fish in Malay and Indonesian), Malaysian Chinese prefer them steamed or cooked in whole, while Malay prefer cooking these fishes with Tempoyak and curry.[10] Pangasius does not have a gourmet reputation and is sold cheaply as swai (/swa\u026a/, from Thai \u0e2a\u0e27\u0e32\u0e22 s\u0304w\u0101y)[11][12] in the United States, panga (or pangas) in Europe and cream dory and basa in several Asian countries and in Australia and the UK. Despite its lowly reputation, the total export of pangasius from Vietnam reached US$1.8 billion in 2014.[13] Pangasius fillets are an increasingly popular product because of their low cost, mild taste and firm texture. Recipes for other whitefish such as sole or halibut can be adapted to pangasius.[14] Pangasius is an omnivorous fish, and thus does not require a high level of animal protein in its diet. Typical grading sizes are 3\u20135\u00a0oz (85\u2013140\u00a0g), 5\u20137\u00a0oz (140\u2013200\u00a0g), and 7\u20139\u00a0oz (200\u2013260\u00a0g).[15] While juvenile iridescent sharks are sold as pets for home aquariums, they are not easy fish to keep. Iridescent sharks are schooling fish that prefer groups,[6] are accustomed to living in rivers, and are active fish that require space. They have very poor eyesight, so detected movement from outside of their habitat can be seen as a threat. If stressed, their first instinct is to flee; a blind dash can cause injury in an aquarium environment. These injuries may result in the fish sinking to the bottom, where it may lie on its side or back until it recovers.[16] Iridescent sharks require a minimum tank size of 12\u00a0m (39\u00a0ft) to develop naturally. Schools require even larger tanks. If given enough room and fed adequately, they can reach 1\u00a0m (3.3\u00a0ft) in length. In most home aquaria, the lack of space stunts their growth. For this reason, most iridescent sharks kept in home aquaria grow to  15 to 30\u00a0cm (6 to 12\u00a0in) in length only and may die prematurely. When provided adequately sized aquaria and proper husbandry, iridescent sharks may live into their teens and grow to full size.[17]"

        "description": " The giant pangasius, paroon shark, pangasid-catfish[1] or Chao Phraya giant catfish (Pangasius sanitwongsei) is a species of freshwater fish in the shark catfish family (Pangasiidae) of order Siluriformes, found in the Chao Phraya and Mekong basins in Indochina. Its populations have declined drastically, mainly due to overfishing, and it is now considered Critically Endangered.[1] The specific name sanitwongsei was chosen to honor M. R. Suwaphan Sanitwong (Thai: \u0e21.\u0e23.\u0e27.\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e27\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e23\u0e13 \u0e2a\u0e19\u0e34\u0e17\u0e27\u0e07\u0e28\u0e4c) for his support of fisheries in Thailand.[2] The species is native to the Mekong and Chao Phraya rivers that run through China, Cambodia, Thailand, Viet Nam, and the Lao People's Democratic Republic. It has been introduced to central Anatolia,[3] South Africa,[4] and Malaysia.[5] The Pangasius sanitwongsei is tolerant of poor quality water,[4] mainly in brackish waters, and prefers to live in the bottom of deep depressions in freshwater rivers.[6][failed verification] The fish live in rivers but are experiencing endangerment due to dams being built, causing the fish to be trapped and unable to migrate.[7] There are currently two sub-populations of Paroon Shark separated by the Khone Falls which they do not migrate over.[8] The Giant Pangasius is a ray-finned fish part of the family Pangasiidae commonly known as Shark Catfishes. They are recognized for having both dorsal and ventral long fins, which help stabilize the fish and keep it upright.[9] This adds to their bilateral symmetry corresponding to their developed swimming ability. Its skin is pigmented with dusky melanophores that help with camouflage in bottom waters. It has a wide, flat, whiskerless head. Its body is compressed and elongate, with a depressed head.[10] It has a continuous and uninterrupted single vomero-palatine teeth patch which is curved.[11] The anal fin has 26 rays and the pectoral spine is similar in size to the dorsal spine and also shows serrations.[10] It has a silver, curved underside and a dark brown back.  Its dorsal, pectoral and pelvic fins are dark gray and the first soft ray is extended into a filament. Its dorsal, adipose, pectoral, and caudal fins are a dark grey to black coloring, with its anal fin and pelvic fins a white to grey coloring.[4] Full-grown adults can reach 300 centimetres (9.8\u00a0ft) SL in length and weigh up to 300\u00a0kg (660\u00a0lb).[12] More commonly the fish's length is around 2 meters.[6] Little is known of the reproduction of P. sanitwongsei, but the time of spawning happens in the months of April and May.[6] It is predicted that spawning happens in the rivers where they are found; they are not believed to be migrating from outside the river when getting ready to spawn.[13] Eggs and sperm are usually released in a muddier area to prevent eggs from sticking to each other.[14] The number of eggs per each spawning is around 600 (with a diameter of 2-2.5mm) and the brood shows low genetic variation.[6] There is no parental care after spawning.[15] The giant pangasius is a benthopelagic and migratory species. Juveniles and adults feed on crustaceans and fishes. These fish typically spawn just prior to the monsoon season.[12] It is believed that the P. sanitwongsei prey on shrimp, crabs, and fish and hideout in deep areas in rivers.[6] The P. sanitwongsei have a seasonal migration but the fish does not leave the river during its migration, it only stays within the river during the seasonal migration.[16] The P. sanitwongsei is a carnivorous fish, whose prey consist of shrimp, crabs, and fish.[6] Since the fish lives on the bottom, it is also known to feed on larger animals' carcasses.[4] Due to it being both an apex predator and a bottom-dwelling fish, it limits the populations of smaller fish as many catfish species. This fish's lifespan isn't known, but it is known that it grows fast[4] and usually the trend is when it grows fast, it dies quickly.[citation needed] The possible reasoning for this could be the fact that there is over-fishing of the species.[3] The P. sanitwongsei's role in the ecosystem is the top predator, therefore inflicts top down control on the population. Top predators aid in the limitation of smaller organisms and in this case they prey on smaller fish keeping the smaller fish in check. Without these carnivorous predators, the smaller fish could overpopulate and throw the food chain into imbalance.[17]  Due to overharvesting, the native fish population may increase since the P. sanitwongsei population is declining.[18] This fish is important to many locals that reside in the regions where the rivers run through as this is an important food source. Many fishing villages rely on the organisms that reside in the river to provide food for their family as well as a source of income as they can sell them at markets. Due to this fish's large known range, it can show us migratory pathways and spawning habits and areas that should be protected, and other areas that can be harvested.[6] This species of fish is also important to fisheries as it can grow to large sizes, even in captivity, and build an economy that relies heavily on fish and other water species. This was a significant reason why it was introduced to rivers in South Africa.[4] These fishes are also valuable asset in the pet trade. They are considered exotic organisms as they are not commonly found in aquariums and are not domesticated. This introduced species in South African rivers can also be a case of release from aquariums once they could no longer be contained due to their high energy need and large size.[4] Fishing of this species used to be accompanied by religious ceremonies and rites. It is often mentioned in textbooks, news media, and popular press. This fish is a popular food fish and marketed fresh.[12] They were introduced to Malaysia for both food and as an ornamental fish. These fish sometimes appear in the aquarium fish hobby. Most specimens do not reach their full size without an extremely large aquarium or pond. There is even a \"balloon\" form of this fish where the fish has an unusually short and stocky body.[19] In addition to fishing for religious purposes, they are also hunted for sport as they are the largest of their kind. They are considered trophy fish and are hunted for prestige and fame. The downside is that these individuals are the most fecund and mature which leads to a decrease in population if too many are harvested at one time. This further makes them a topic of conservation as they play key roles in their ecosystem.[20] This fish is highly protected and has a high conservation value and is banned from being fished through all seasons.[21] The fish is being threatened by overharvesting, damming of rivers, and pollution. Their population continues to decline as there are not many legislations and enforcement toward this species. A common threat to these large organisms is dams and segmentation of the Mekong River. The Paroon shark travels upstream to spawn and resides downstream. The construction of dams leads to segmentation of the natural habitat.[22] Even though the bodies of water are interconnected these fish are not capable of swimming through walls to get to their natural breeding sites. Aside from being threatened by anthropogenic causes, the Giant Pangasius is considered an umbrella species in conservation. Protecting this species would provide protection for species that inhabit the same region. With this tactic, a whole ecosystem can be preserved. Due to this area being an area that is highly fished commercially and locally, certain regulations can be put in place to manage the size of the fish that can be caught allowing mature adults to reproduce with greater success. [23] A known breeding practice, to try and help the population, is being practiced by the Thai government.[6] A halt on harvesting has been recommended until the P. sanitwongsei's population can rise to a safe level.[6] Even though these fish are grown in a safe fishery, this can reduce the genetic diversity between them making them more susceptible to disease as well as environmental stress. To control the amount of overharvesting (via fishing) that occurs certain size and catch limits can be put in place. In 1989, the Paroon shark was listed as a class II protected species by the government of Yunnan, China.[8] The issue is that the habitat of this species lies in multiple countries' domains including Cambodia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Thailand, and Viet Nam. Restrictions in parts of the river that reside in China's territory, leave the other parts to be unprotected. There are some groups in the Asian continent who have been trying to protect and conserve the wildlife in these regions including the Asian Species Action Partnership (ASAP), Species Survival Commission (SSC), World Wildlife Fund (WWF), and International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN).[24]"

It may also be called Southern striped Raphael, talking catfish, chocolate doradid, chocolate catfish or thorny catfish.[1] It is native to the Amazon, Paraguay\u2013Paran\u00e1 and lower Orinoco basins in South America.[2] This peaceful, nocturnal species is a popular aquarium fish due to its pleasant temperament and curious nature.[3] Despite its name \"talking catfish\", it does not speak. This catfish has long been confused with Platydoras costatus of Suriname and French Guiana, where the pale stripe on the body does not extend onto the head.[2] These fish burrow in the soft river bottoms and frequently occurs on sandy bottoms.[4] These fish feed on mollusks, crustaceans and organic debris.[4] They have rigid pectoral fin spines. The striped Raphael catfish also has tiny and curved protective spines running along its body. The typically reported maximum standard length of this species is 20\u201324\u00a0cm (7.9\u20139.4\u00a0in).[5][6] Considerably larger individuals, up to 43\u00a0cm (17\u00a0in) long, have been reported from the Tocantins\u2013Araguaia basin,[4][7] but this population, together with those from the Tapaj\u00f3s and Xingu, likely represent an undescribed species (not to be confused with P. birindellii, a species from the Xingu basin that was described in 2018).[2][8] Juvenile striped raphael catfish have been recorded cleaning piscivorous fish such as Hoplias cf. malabaricus. The stripe pattern in the young may serve as a signal that allows for its recognition as a cleaner. It is noted that the striping pattern is not as strong in adults, and so the cleaning behavior is probably only seen in juveniles.[9] The striped Raphael catfish is a fine and sociable community fish that are peaceful to fellow catfishes and other fish species.[3] However, they are nocturnal, and are usually not visible during the day.[3] It is best not to catch the striped Raphael catfish with a fish net because they are prone to sticking out their pectoral fin spines in a very rigid manner, especially if stressed. Untangling these spines from a net is difficult and dangerous to both handler and fish. Alternative methods should be used.\nAlthough known as a spawning fish, sexual differences are unknown and there have been no reports of being successfully bred in captivity.[3] Because of this, these fish must be wild-caught, and therefore related species of similar appearance sometimes appear in the hobby, such as Orinocodoras eigenmanni, which differs in a longer snout.[3]\nThe Raphael catfish will make some grunting/squeaking noises while out of water.\nAlthough generally sociable with other fish, sometimes this fish can feed on smaller fish so take care when introducing one to an established tank."

        "description": " Asterophysus batrachus, the gulper catfish or ogre catfish, is a species of catfish (order Siluriformes) of the family Auchenipteridae. It is native to the Rio Negro and Orinoco  basins in Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela,[1][2] where mostly found in slow-moving waters with many submerged structures.[3] It is currently the only recognized species of the genus Asterophysus,[4] but a specimen that possibly represents an undescribed species has been collected in Maraj\u00f3 (about 1,200\u00a0km or 750\u00a0mi from the traditionally recognized range of A. batrachus).[5] The gulper catfish grows to a standard length of 25\u00a0cm (9.8\u00a0in),[1] and a total length of 28.5\u00a0cm (11.2\u00a0in).[6] It has a short, thick-set shape and is dark-colored with a whitish belly.[6] People in its native range typically will not eat it because they consider it very ugly,[7] but it is sometimes kept in aquariums.[8] The gulper catfish is a strict carnivore and swallows its prey, mostly other fish, whole. This prey can be exceptionally large for its size, sometimes even larger than the gulper catfish itself,[8] although such feeding attempts can be unsuccessful.[3] The catfish catches prey by biting on the head. Escaping out of the mouth is generally prevented by the fine, backwards-pointing teeth of the catfish. Instead the struggles of the prey cause it to be further engulfed and eventually ending up folded (with both its head and tail pointing towards the predator's head) in the greatly extendable gulper catfish stomach.[6][9] The fully extended stomach may result in an abnormal appearance of the gulper catfish to the point where its swimming can be impaired. It may also swallow large amounts of water only to expel it later along with remains of earlier prey.[6] Potential prey fish are apparently unable to recognize the gulper catfish as dangerous because fish will not generally consider other fish of roughly similar size as a major threat, and because of its slow, unobtrusive approach.[6][9] A common observed attack is the catfish quickly turning to the side and biting on the head of the targeted fish. Even if the first attempt fails, the gulper catfish will not try to pursue it. The prey will typically still not realize that the catfish represents a threat and can be caught using the same approach.[6] Another method of catching prey was observed by a snorkeler in the Atabapo River. Here the gulper catfish live in crevices between rocks and dart out to catch passing prey such as angelfish.[10] In aquariums gulper catfish will feed during both day and night, but it is suspected the species is nocturnal and crepuscular in the wild, giving it an additional advantage when hunting along river banks for its often sleeping prey.[6]"

This species was once also commonly called Brochis coeruleus. W. A. Gosline was the first to suspect that the two species were the same in 1940, but it was actually Njiseen & Isbr\u00fccker, in 1970, who combined the two, giving sufficient reasons for doing so. The species would be described as Brochis splendens, until most of the catfish formerly classified as Brochis were re-classified into Corydoras.[2] The current recognized classification is thus Corydoras splendens.[1] It is native to the upper reaches Amazon Basin.[1] This includes Ucayali River to Pucallpa, Ambiyacu River, and the area around Iquitos in western Brazil, southeastern Colombia, eastern Ecuador and eastern Peru. Depending upon the angle of lighting, the fish's body reflects a metallic green, blue-green, or even a bluish color.  The ventral area is yellowish with the pectoral, ventral, and anal fins yellowish and the dorsal, caudal, and adipose fins a translucent brownish.  The females are larger and more robust than the males, and have a more pinkish belly as opposed to the more yellowish one for the males. This fish can be distinguished from the green/bronze corydoras catfish by its usually larger size, stouter body, and more pointed snout. The fish inhabits sluggish waters with dense vegetation along the banks.[1] It occurs in shallow muddy waters and will grow in length up to 7.5\u00a0centimetres (3\u00a0in).[1] It lives in a tropical climate in water with a 5.8\u20138.0 pH, a water hardness of 2\u201330 dGH, and a temperature range of 22\u201328\u00a0\u00b0C (72\u201382\u00a0\u00b0F).[1] It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, and insect larvae. It lays eggs in dense vegetation and adults do not guard the eggs. The emerald catfish is a common species in freshwater aquaria.  It is a peaceful, undemanding species and can be maintained under the same conditions as most Corydoras species.  They are shy and easily frightened when kept as individuals, so it is best kept in small groups of at least three, with more being recommended.  The tank should have only a soft, fine bottom to prevent damage to barbels and should be heavily planted.[4] Feeding is not difficult and they accept almost anything, although live worms are especially appreciated.[5] It does well in a community tank and does not tear up the plants.[5] Spawning has been achieved in captivity.[4] Typically, the fish are separated into a breeding tank in the ratio of three males to two females, all well-conditioned on live foods.  The couple will spawn while sitting on the bottom, not while swimming as many similar species do. In captivity, the female collects the eggs in her pelvic fin basket and pastes them individually to plants and other objects.  Eggs will be deposited by the female throughout the tank, but especially on any floating surface plants.  According to most reports, the parents do not immediately try to eat the eggs.  The eggs hatch in about four days and the fry become free swimming two days later."

The optimal water chemistry for the development of eggs varies from author to author and it may thus depend on the origin of the fish population.[original research?] At 26\u00a0\u00b0C the fry hatch after four days and start to eat after another four days. Raising the fry may not be fully trouble-free, however.[citation needed][original research?] The fish is named in honor of aquarium-fish collector and exporter Adolfo Schwartz.[3]  This Callichthyidae-related article is a stub.

        "description": " The banded corydoras or bearded catfish (Scleromystax barbatus) is a subtropical freshwater fish belonging to the subfamily Corydoradinae of the family Callichthyidae. It originates in coastal drainages in South America from Rio de Janeiro to Santa Catarina, Brazil.[2] It was originally described as Callichthys barbatus by Jean Ren\u00e9 Constant Quoy & Joseph Paul Gaimard in 1824, from which it was transferred to genus Corydoras as Corydoras barbatus, a name which by which it is still being referred to in the aquarium industry. The species was further transferred to genus Scleromystax in 2003.[3] The fish will grow in length up to 9.8\u00a0centimetres (3.9\u00a0in).[2] This species has pronounced sexual dimorphism. The dorsal and pectoral fins of males reach, or almost reach, the caudal peduncle, and well-developed odontodes are inserted in fleshy tissue on a large area on the sides of the snout in fully grown males.[4] The banded corydoras lives in a subtropical climate in water with a 6.0\u20138.0 pH, a water hardness of 2\u201325 dGH, and a temperature of 68\u00a0\u00b0F (20\u00a0\u00b0C) to 82\u00a0\u00b0F (28\u00a0\u00b0C).[2] It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. It lays eggs in dense vegetation and adults do not guard the eggs. In captivity, as the sperm are released the female sinks to the bottom, resting on one of her pectoral fins while she starts fanning with the other pectoral fin. At this time, some eggs are released which fall into the pelvic fin basket and are apparently fertilized at that time. The banded corydoras is of commercial importance in the aquarium trade industry. Though peaceful, they get larger than most Corydoras and are therefore less suitable for small aquaria.[5]  This Callichthyidae-related article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it."

        "description": " The bronze corydoras  (Corydoras aeneus), also known as the green corydoras, bronze catfish, lightspot corydoras or wavy catfish, is a species of freshwater fish in the armored catfish family, Callichthyidae, often kept as an aquarium fish. It is widely distributed in South America on the eastern side of the Andes, from Colombia and Trinidad to the R\u00edo de la Plata basin;[2] however, as presently defined it is a species complex and a taxonomic review is necessary.[3] It was originally described as Hoplosoma aeneum (based on a specimen from Trinidad) by Theodore Gill in 1858 and has historically also been referred to as Callichthys aeneus.[2] The adult size is 6\u00bd cm for males and a slightly larger 7\u00a0cm for females (2\u00bd to 2\u00be inches).[4]   Females have a slightly higher body frame than males in accordance with their larger abdominal region. Their average life span is 10 years. It has a yellow or pink body, white belly, and is blue-grey over its head and back. Its fins are yellow or pink and immaculate. In common with most Corydoras the dorsal, pectoral and adipose fins have an additional sharp barb and have a mild poison which causes fish which try to attack them to get stung. A brownish-orange patch is usually present on the head, just before the dorsal fin, and is its most distinctive feature when viewed from above in the stream. Their upper sides are often a greenish color, which is the reason another common name for this fish is the green corydoras. Like many other catfishes, females are larger than males in this species.[5] They are found in quiet, shallow waters with soft bottoms that can sometimes be heavily polluted by clouds of disturbed mud from the bottom, but it also inhabits running waters.[2] In its native habitat, it inhabits waters with a temperature range of 25\u00a0\u00b0C to 28\u00a0\u00b0C (77\u00a0\u00b0F to 82\u00a0\u00b0F), pH 6.0\u20138.0, and hardness 5 to 19 DGH.[2] Like most members of the genus Corydoras, these catfish have a unique method of coping with the low oxygen content that prevails in such environments. In addition to utilizing their gills like any other fish, they rapidly come to the surface of the water and draw air in through their mouth. This air is then absorbed through the wall of the intestine and any surplus air is expelled through the vent.[2] It typically stays in schools of 20 to 30 individuals.[2] It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter.[2] Reproduction occurs with the onset of the rainy season, which changes the water chemistry.[2] Females spawn 10\u201320 egg-clutches with multiple males at a time, but an entire egg clutch is inseminated by the sperm of a single male.[5] In laboratory observations, it was found that bronze corydoras have a unique method of insemination. When these fish reproduce, the male will present his abdomen to the female. The female will attach her mouth to the male's genital opening, creating the well-known \"T-position\" many Corydoras exhibit during courtship. The female will then drink the sperm. The sperm rapidly moves through her intestines and is discharged together with her eggs into a pouch formed by her pelvic fins. The female can then swim away and deposit the pouch somewhere else alone. Because the T-position is exhibited in other species than just C. aeneus, it is likely that they also exhibit this behavior.[6] In the wild, eggs are laid on waterweeds.[5] Males do not form territories or compete over females; interference between males might only happen when two males present their abdomens simultaneously. On the other hand, females do not choose between males. Mating is more or less random; therefore, male reproductive success is directly related to courtship frequency.[5] The eggs of C. aeneus exhibit a unique surface pattern with small villi-like protuberances which resemble attaching-filaments of teleost eggs. These structures allow the eggs to be adhesive and stick to a specific place or to each other. The presence of these structures may be related to the turbid habitat in which this species lives.[7] Bronze corydoras are probably the most popular Corydoras species.[8] It is annually bred and shipped in large quantities all over the world[9] It is easily bred and is produced in commercial quantities in the United States, Europe, and Singapore. Most of the available fish are therefore domestic strains. Wild imports are reported to be less easy to breed.[citation needed] They are a hardy and useful aquarium fish despite having a coloration that is by no means striking or unusual. Many aquarists are fascinated by the habits of these fish. They ceaselessly comb the bottom of the aquarium for food and therefore disturb it slightly, sending up detritus and waste material that has settled loosely on the bottom. They prefer being kept in groups of 5 or more, being sociable fish and are ideal fish for a community tank.[2] Other Corydoras species can be placed in the same aquarium, and despite the strong resemblance many species bear to one another, the species will tend to separate out and only move about among their own kind. Corydoras aeneus is not particular about the composition of the water. Adequate conditions are a temperature range of 20 to 28\u00a0\u00b0C (68 to 82\u00a0\u00b0F), pH of 6.0\u20138.0, and hardness of 2\u201330 DGH. The water should have no salt added to it.[8] A fairly dense growth of plants with a number of possible hiding places is greatly appreciated. Corys are easy to feed, they are omnivores eating all flake and pelleted food and also live and frozen foods. When it comes to sperm, then the female glues the eggs, only a few in number, to the chosen substrate and then (sometimes) quickly touches them with her mouth. After several acts of spawning, which span a total of two to three hours, one female will have produced up to 200 eggs. Frequently, two males are used for each female, as one male has difficulty fertilizing all the eggs. The eggs gradually grow darker in color, and just prior to hatching (ranging from three days at 28\u00a0\u00b0C to a week at 20\u00a0\u00b0C) they turn dark brown. The fry keep to the bottom of the tank, feeding on detritus and any fine foods available. The parents may spawn again within two to three weeks. The albino corydoras is an albino variety of the bronze corydoras that has been developed for the aquarium trade, with a pale pink or orange body and red eyes.  It is physically similar to normally-colored individuals, although some breeders report that the fry are a little slower to develop.[10] Others say that the albinos are practically blind and that the males are somewhat sterile, although this may be due to extensive inbreeding.[11] Albino bronze corydoras are frequently injected with bright dye (via a needle) and sold in aquariums. This controversial practice is known as \"painting\" or \"juicing\" fish."

Use round gravel or smooth sand for the aquarium because the barbels can be damaged easily.[4] A community of at least six fish is ideal.[5] Corydoras nanus is of commercial importance in the aquarium trade industry.

It lays eggs in dense vegetation, and adults do not guard the eggs. Unlike most Corydoras species but similar to the other \"saddlenoses\", C. narcissus tend to occur in small groups (not larger groups) and especially during the breeding period mature males are quite aggressive towards each other.[3][7] The species was first collected by Herbert R. Axelrod and Martin R. Brittan. It was first described and named narcissus by Han Nijssen and Isa\u00e4c J. H. Isbr\u00fccker to recognize the collectors \"for their many naming suggestions\".[8]"

        "description": " The dwarf corydoras (Corydoras hastatus), dwarf catfish, tail spot pygmy catfish, or micro catfish is a tropical freshwater fish belonging to the subfamily Corydoradinae of the family Callichthyidae.  It originates in inland waters in South America, and is found in the Amazon River and Paraguay River basins in Argentina, Bolivia, and Brazil.[1] The specific epithet hastatus means with a spear, in reference to the spearhead-like spot on the tail root. The body of Corydoras hastatus is typically more elongated than other Corydoras species.  Its body is a translucent white to olive color, with a thin dark stripe on the sides from behind the gill cover to the root of the tail, and a whitish belly.  It has a white crescent at the base of the tail surrounding a black spot.  The fish will grow in length up to 1.4 inches (3.5\u00a0cm), but 1.0 inch (2.5\u00a0cm) is more typical.  Males are smaller, more slender and have a more pointed dorsal fin than females. The dwarf corydoras lives in a (sub)tropical climate in water with a 6.0\u20138.0 pH, a water hardness of 5\u201319 dGH, and a temperature range of 68\u201382 F (20\u201328\u00a0\u00b0C).[1] It is found in ponds.[1] It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. They are found in the Paraguay River and Amazon River basins. C. hastatus lives among plants.[1] It is a schooling species.[1] It differs from most Corydoras species by preferring the midwater areas instead of the bottom, spending most of its time well off the bottom in areas of dense plants.  When it rests, it rests on the leaves of the plants.  Other Corydoras species with similar mid-water habits include C. habrosus and C. pygmaeus. The dwarf Corydoras maintains its position in a current by using rapid fin movements, especially with its pectoral fins. These rapid movements, combined with a high breathing rate, give the fish the appearance of being very \"nervous\" when compared with other fish. C. hastatus may even shoal with small characins. The fish lays its eggs in dense vegetation and the adults do not guard the eggs.  The female holds a single egg between her pelvic fins, where the male fertilizes them for about 30 seconds.  Only then does the female swim to a suitable spot, where she attaches the sticky egg. The pair repeats this process about every three minutes for from one to two hours with some 10- to 15-minute rests between egg releases.  Around 7 to 15 eggs are spawned in a single day, and spawning occurs on three to four consecutive days. A total of 30 to 60 eggs may be spawned by a single female over this period of time. The eggs hatch in three to nine days.  The fry are about 6\u00a0mm long at hatching, mostly translucent but sometimes with spots. In two months, the fry average about 18\u00a0mm in length.  The fry mature in six to eight months. The dwarf corydoras is of commercial importance in the aquarium trade industry.   Due to its small size, this fish can be kept in a relatively small aquarium; a 5-gallon (20 litre) tank is sufficient for a small school.  Since it is a schooling fish, it should only be kept in groups of at least six individuals.  It is a good community tank fish when kept with peaceful tankmates such as tetras, rasboras, and danios, but should not be kept with overly aggressive tankmates.  They have also been used as scavengers for fry tanks. The aquarium should be clean, well-aerated, and densely planted to provide hiding places.  A moderate current provided by a power filter or canister filter is appreciated.  The water should be slightly alkaline (pH about 7.6) within a temperature range of 24\u00b0 to 29\u00a0\u00b0C.  Although the fish is generally a mid-water dweller, a fine gravel or sand substrate should be provided since it will occasionally burrow. The fish will feed both in midwater or on a substrate, whether that substrate is a plant leaf, a broad rock, or the bottom of the tank.  It accepts most foods, including freeze-dried, flake, and frozen foods, although live foods are particularly appreciated. The methods of spawning this fish in the aquarium is similar to spawning most other Corydoras species.  The spawning tank can be as small as 2.5 gallons (10 L), but at least a 5-gallon (20 L) tank is recommended with aged water, a sponge filter and some plants.  Fish should be conditioned with large amounts of live foods such as Tubifex and whiteworms, during which time the females will become noticeably plumper.  Since C. hastatus may spawn as a school, the whole group can be conditioned for spawning at the same time, and for best results, there should be at least two males for every female. Spawning of well-conditioned fish may be initiated by the addition of cooler water.  During spawning, very little food is accepted, but the fish will immediately search for food after finishing.  It will typically attach its eggs to the plants in the aquarium, but if not enough plants are available, the sides of the aquarium may be used.  When the fry hatch, they can be fed newly hatched brine shrimp or microworms.  The parents may be ready to spawn again in a couple of weeks."

It originates in inland waters in South America, and is found in the Upper Amazon River basin in Brazil, Colombia and Peru. The specific epithet elegans means elegant. The fish's appearance is characterized by dark double longitudinal stripes. The dorsal fin is ornamented by a few gray dots, taking on an arching pattern in some individuals. The body has other gray and black markings on an olive background. Compared with other species of Corydoras, the body is not as tall in comparison to its length, and its eyes are set a bit lower. The fish will grow in length up to 5.1 centimetres (2.0 inches). It lives in a tropical climate in water with a 6.0 - 8.0 pH, a water hardness of 2 \u2013 25 dGH, and a temperature range of 22\u201326\u00a0\u00b0C (72\u201379\u00a0\u00b0F). It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. Though it lays eggs in dense vegetation, adults do not guard them. In captivity, the male is reportedly territorial during the prespawning activities while the female is usually hidden among the plant roots. Both sexes clean the underside of plant leaves. Eggs are fastened under the leaves and are also attached to roots of plants. The elegant corydoras is of commercial importance in the aquarium trade industry. It tends to swim in the upper levels of the aquarium, instead of at the bottom as is common with most species of Corydoras, and does not seem to disturb the sediment as much."

        "description": " Corydoras panda is a species of catfish belonging to the genus Corydoras, of the family Callichthyidae, and is a native member of the riverine fauna of South America.  It is found in Peru and Ecuador, most notably in the Hu\u00e1nuco region, where it inhabits the R\u00edo Aquas, the R\u00edo Amarillae, a tributary of the R\u00edo Pachitea, and the R\u00edo Ucayali river system. The species was first collected by Randolph H. Richards in 1968, and was named Corydoras panda by Nijssen and Isbr\u00fccker in 1971. The specific name is an allusion to the appearance of the fish, which possesses large black patches surrounding the eyes, reminiscent of those found on the giant panda. Accordingly, the common names for this fish, which is a popular aquarium species, are panda corydoras and panda catfish. Corydoras panda has an off-white to pinkish-orange ground colour, and when observed under certain lighting conditions, a faint greenish iridescence is present upon the flanks and the operculum. The fins of the fish match the body in ground colour, upon close inspection being seen to be hyaline or translucent with coloured fin rays, with the dorsal fin being marked by a conspicuous black blotch that covers almost the entire fin area. The caudal peduncle is marked with a black band, this black band encircling the caudal peduncle from dorsal to ventral surface. The adipose fin, supported by a small fin spine, sometimes contains black pigmentation. The head is the same ground colour as the body, with a black mask surrounding the eyes, descending vertically from the fontanel, over each eye, and ending in a triangular wedge immediately before the ventral surface of the head. The pectoral fins are positioned immediately behind the operculum, and are usually oriented horizontally when the fish is at rest, extended in a manner similar to the wings of an aeroplane. The pelvic fins are positioned upon the ventral surface of the fish, located some way behind the pectoral fins. The first ray of the dorsal fin emanates from the body at approximately its point of greatest elevation, and a vertical line drawn downwards from this point meets the attachment point of the pelvic fins. The anal fin is located far to the rear of the ventral surface of the body, the attachment point of the first fin ray being somewhat forward of the black caudal peduncle marking described above. In common with all other members of the family Callichthyidae, the body surface is covered, not with scales, but with bony plates known as scutes. The lines of demarcation between individual scutes can be seen upon close examination of this and almost all other Callichthyid fishes, and in the case of some specimens of this species, are highlighted by additional black pigment. The fish possesses, in common with almost all Corydoras species, three pairs of barbels\u2014one pair of maxillary barbels and two pairs of rictal barbels. A fully mature adult specimen of this species attains a standard length of 55 millimetres (2.1\u00a0inches): this is the length attained by mature females, which grow larger than mature males, and also possess more rounded body outlines. Corydoras panda inhabits clear river waters that are relatively fast-flowing, well-oxygenated, and flowing over substrates that may comprise soft sand or fine gravel. These rivers are usually well vegetated with assorted species of aquatic plants. The proximity of the home rivers of the fish to the Andes mountain range, and the replenishment of those rivers with meltwaters from Andean snows at higher altitudes, has led the fish to be adaptable to cooler temperatures than the norm for 'tropical' fishes\u2014the temperature range of the fish is 16\u00a0\u00b0C to 28\u00a0\u00b0C, though the fish exhibits a marked preference for the cooler regions of this temperature spectrum, particularly in captivity. Indeed, the fish can, for small time-periods, survive temperatures as low as 12\u00a0\u00b0C, though captive rearing at such low temperatures is ill-advised. The native waters of Corydoras panda are consequently mineral-deficient, with a neutral to slightly acid pH, and replication of such conditions in captivity are recommended for successful maintenance. Corydoras panda has a preference for cooler than normal waters when compared to many other popular tropical fish species. Because of this, those who keep C. panda in community aquarium setting must choose tankmates that share its preference for cooler temperatures of around 20\u00a0\u00b0C (68\u00a0\u00b0F) to 25\u00a0\u00b0C (77\u00a0\u00b0F).[2] Given the cleanliness of the fish's native waters, scrupulous attention to water quality in the aquarium is considerably more important for this fish than for the more domesticated Corydoras species such as C. paleatus or C. aeneus. Additionally, scrupulous attention to aquarium substrate cleanliness is a must, as the fish are intolerant of poor aquarium maintenance in this area, and succumb to stress and disease rapidly if their aquaria are not kept to a high standard. Despite this, the species remains highly popular with aquarists, upon account of the appearance of the fish, and its lively, vivacious behaviour in a well-planned aquarium setting. Like many other Corydoras species, the panda catfish is a highly gregarious fish, and in common with several other smaller Corydoras species such as C. habrosus and C. pygmaeus, manifests a distinct need for numerous companions of its own species in order to thrive, and can thus be described as being more avowedly social than some of the larger members of the genus. A minimum of eight individuals should be housed in the same aquarium, and if space permits, this number should be revised upwards, as the fish exhibits a very definite preference for grouping together with others of its species. They also associate themselves easily with the clown loach and school together in currents where sufficient numbers of their own species is lacking. An aquarium for this species should be well furnished, ideally with a mixture of live aquatic plants, and solid furnishings providing caves, sheltered areas and hiding places to give the fish security. Floating plants to provide additional areas of shade are also welcomed by the fish. Like all Corydoras species, the fish feeds primarily upon animal matter. The aquarist is advised, however, that the traditional use of Corydoras catfishes as putative 'scavengers' in an aquarium setting will be detrimental to the well-being of this species\u2014it requires high quality foods for long-term maintenance, and a varied diet. Ideally, the fish should be given live foods at least intermittently, and will dine enthusiastically upon such items as Bloodworms (larvae of Chironomus midges), Daphnia, cultivated Brine Shrimp (Atermia salina), and Tubifex worms. The last, however, should be cultivated in order to minimise the risk of introducing pathogenic organisms to the aquarium, as Tubifex live in unsanitary conditions in the wild. Freeze dried Tubifex may be preferable, as the risk of introduction of disease is eliminated. High quality flake foods are also appreciated, particularly those containing shrimp or other similar matter. The lifespan of Corydoras panda in the aquarium has not been systematically determined, but given the longevity of other Corydoras species in the aquarium, it is reasonable to assume that well-cared for specimens will enjoy a lifespan in excess of ten years, and frequently in excess of 15 years. Corydoras panda follows, with a few minor deviations, the standard model for breeding for the genus. Stimulus for breeding consists of the influx of cooler, oxygenated waters into their habitat, usually corresponding in the wild with the onset of the rainy season. However, while some Corydoras species require a temperature drop in the aquarium for spawning to be stimulated, in the case of Corydoras panda, the temperature drop appears to matter much less, as specimens have spawned in the aquarium without a temperature drop. The addition of new, clean, oxygenated water appears to be the primary stimulus for this species. In the wild, the appearance of new water courtesy of the rains is followed by an increase in the populations of assorted food organisms, and feeding upon these conditions the fishes for breeding. Once conditioned fish are stimulated into spawning, males begin chasing females energetically. Females begin developing eggs within their reproductive tracts, and when 'ripe' (laden with eggs), become receptive to the attentions of the males. Eventually, one male will succeed in courting a female, using his barbels to provide stimulation to the female, usually beginning with caresses of the female's caudal peduncle, followed by caresses of the fontanel and the front of the head. if the female is receptive, then the male positions himself before the female, so that the female's mouth is in close proximity with one of the male's pectoral fins. The male then clasps the female's barbels between the pectoral fin and the body, and this stimulates the female to press against the male's side. When seen from above, the fish form a 'T' shape when conjoined thus, hence the term 'T position' has become conventional in aquarium circles when describing the breeding of Corydoras catfishes. Once the male and female are in the 'T position', the pressing of the female against the male's body stimulates his release of sperm. Though the exact mechanism of fertilisation has yet to be scientifically documented, from the observations of aquarists who have been successful in breeding Corydoras catfishes, it seems likely that the female takes the male's sperm through her mouthparts, and directs them through the gills, in a current that carries the sperm to her pelvic fins. At this point, the female releases a single egg (occasionally two), and purses her pelvic fins in order to provide a receptacle for the freshly extruded egg, which is then fertilised. One difference observed between the adoption of the 'T position' in Corydoras panda, when compared to other Corydoras species, is that the exercise is frequently more acrobatic in appearance, with the 'T position' being adopted in mid-water, some distance above the substrate, rather than resting upon the substrate as is the case with the majority of other Corydoras. Once the female is carrying a fertilised egg within her pelvic fins, she then seeks an egg deposition site. The choice of such a site is frequently, though not always, a mass of fine leaved aquatic vegetation. In the aquarium, the plant known as Java moss, Vesicularia dubayana, is of considerable utility as an egg repository for Corydoras catfishes, even though the plant is not a South American native, and panda catfish females will choose large clumps of this plant readily as safe deposition sites for fertilised eggs. The female is frequently pursued by one or more males as she seeks the deposition site, each male presumably seeking to be the chosen mate to fertilise the next egg. Up to 25 eggs may be produced by a single female during a single spawning, which may take place over four to five hours. Fertile Corydoras panda eggs require approximately 3\u20134 days development time before hatching, if kept at a temperature of 22\u00a0\u00b0C. This development time will vary with temperature, taking longer in cooler water. Upon hatching, the fry are four millimetres long, translucent, but already possessing the basic ground colour of the species, and upon close examination, possess fully formed barbels. Even newly hatched fry possess at least some hint of the adult eye patches, and as the fry grow, these patches darken and become more prominent. Even so, at just four millimetres in length, the fry are practically invisible against typical aquarium gravel unless seen to move. The fry take approximately four weeks to develop to the point where the finfold, a continuous undifferentiated membrane resembling that seen at the posterior of a tadpole, has differentiated into the unpaired fins (dorsal, anal and caudal fins). During this time, size will have increased to approximately eight or nine millimetres, and the fish will begin to develop colour changes leading to that of the adult fish. From this point, the caudal peduncle patch and dorsal fin patch will begin to appear, but the body will also be seen to be covered in fine black 'pepper dots' between these black patches. Only after a period of 10 to 12 weeks, at which point the fish has assumed a size of 12 to 14 millimetres, will the fish attain the colouration of the adult, and be in all respects a perfect miniature of the parents. Fry of this species are particularly sensitive to changes in water chemistry and to elevated temperatures. While adult fishes can withstand temperatures of 28\u00a0\u00b0C, fry will die of heat stress if exposed to temperatures above 26\u00a0\u00b0C, and their chances of survival are enhanced if the water temperature is kept at 22\u00a0\u00b0C or below. Water changes made to a nursery aquarium during the first 21 days of life of the fry\u2014the critical period during which they manifest the greatest sensitivity to their environment\u2014must be gradual, and the incoming water conditioned to match that of the existing aquarium water where possible before the water change takes place. While the fry are likely to develop best if given infusoria as part of their feeding r\u00e9gime, it is possible to raise fry to adulthood entirely upon prepared foods."

        "description": " Corydoras paleatus is a species of catfish (order Siluriformes) of the family Callichthyidae. Its common names include blue leopard corydoras, mottled corydoras, and peppered catfish.[1] It originates from the lower Paran\u00e1 River basin and coastal rivers in Uruguay and Brazil.[1] This fish species reach about 5.9 - 7 centimeters (2.3 - 2.75 \u00a0in) SL.[1] The male is smaller than the female, and in proportion to body length, the dorsal fin and pectoral fins are longer on the male than the female.[2] Corydoras paleatus is found in the Amazon basin,[1] and feeds on worms, crustaceans, insects, and plant matter.[1] C. paleatus has been known to produce sound; it does this by the abduction of its pectoral fins. This is used by males during courtship and intrapersonal communication, and by both sexes and juveniles when distressed.[2] In reproduction, males do not behave aggressively toward each other, nor do they monopolize mating areas or females.[2] The T-position is involved in courtship, as with many other Corydoras species.[2] Charles Darwin discovered the C. paleatus when he went to Buenos Aires during his expedition aboard the Beagle during the 1830s.[3] It is a very good choice for the community aquarium, as it is a hardy,[4] good-looking, and peaceful fish.[4] They can be successfully kept with other small, peaceful aquarium fish like livebearers, danios, and tetras. It is sometimes seen in the shops as an albino form, although this is similar to other albino corys (see the C. aeneus albino form). It grows to around 7.5\u00a0cm and is easily bred at home. These fish prefer a planted tank with temperatures around 16 to 24 \u00b0C (61 \u2013 75 \u00b0F), although they can take lower temperatures than this as it originates from colder waters.[3] Their high temperature tolerance seems poor, and 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F) is the highest safe temperature. They like to nibble on the algae that grow on floating plants but are not specialized algae-eating catfish. The lighting must not be too bright, and hiding places, such as bogwood, are needed as they like to hide from the light during certain parts of the day. Heavily planted areas should also be provided, where the light is minimized, as they like darker areas due to their bottom-feeding nature. Diet should be sinking pellets, algae wafers, frozen and live food, such as bloodworm or daphnia. They may also occasionally enjoy blanched spinach, which can be attached to plants with a peg or the side of the glass with magnetic clips. They can be seen to dart to the top of the tank: this is because they can use atmospheric oxygen to supplement what their gills extract from the water.[5] They will do this more frequently  when water quality is starting to deteriorate, and so should be watched for this indication. Peppered corydoras reach their sexual maturity and start to show reproductive behaviors once the females reach an average (minimum) size of 5.625 cm (2.214 inches) and once the males reach about 4.875 cm (1.919 inches).[citation needed] The males initiate the courtship ritual, which entails chasing the females around the tank. The female darts away, and the males search for her and find her a few moments later. The males shiver all over the female and may lie down on top of her. When she is ready to spawn, she turns to the male next to her and pounds below his ventral fin. The pair go into the \"T-position\" with the male releasing the sperm into the female's mouth before the sperm fertilizes the eggs[citation needed]. The female cups her ventral fins and lays a few eggs (usually between 4 and 12 eggs[citation needed]) in her fins.  The eggs are about 1.8 mm in diameter[citation needed]. The female now starts cleaning a spot on the glass to put her eggs on. Corydoras are egg depositors and lay their eggs all over the aquarium. Favorite spots include the heater, filters, and the glass, although, occasionally eggs are also laid on plants and driftwood. After depositing a group of eggs closely together, the female rests for a few moments. The males regroup and start chasing each other and then resume chasing the female. The males are so relentless in this pursuit that they try to mate with the female even while she is busy laying her eggs. The spawning lasts more than an hour, and many eggs are laid in different places. On average, about 50 to 150 eggs are laid during a single spawning[citation needed]. The incubation period for the eggs for peppered corydoras was found to be between 96 hours and 113 hours at 24\u00b12\u00b0C, with the average incubation period being about 102 hours (or 4.25 days)[citation needed]. In one study, the average hatching ratio of the eggs was found to be approximately 87%, with the overall egg-laying period lasting between 20 and 35 days[citation needed]. Peppered cories can eat their eggs, but will not eat the living fry.  At first, the fry is small (with a mean length of 7.5246 mm[citation needed]) and is unable to eat, sustaining themselves on the last of their yolk sacs. The fry will begin to eat 1\u20133 days after hatching, and will eat the protozoan organisms in the tank and can be fed powdered food at this stage.  By about one month, the fry will start to become rounder and will begin developing adult coloration, eventually becoming miniature versions of the adults[citation needed]. The juveniles will reach adult size at around 1 year of age, although this varies between individuals and how well they are kept. The age of sexual maturity also varies between individuals, but juveniles will typically begin breeding at around 8\u201312 months of age. However, they can begin as early as 6 months and as late as 18 months of age. From the onset of sexual maturity, it can take the fish up to another year to successfully produce fertile eggs; at first, entire clutches of eggs may be infertile. Albino strains may develop slower and be less fertile due to inbreeding. Media related to Corydoras paleatus at Wikimedia Commons"

        "description": " Corydoras pygmaeus, or the pygmy corydoras or pygmy catfish[1] is a tropical and freshwater fish belonging to the subfamily Corydoradinae of the family Callichthyidae. It originates in tropical inland waters in South America, and is found in the Madeira River basin in Brazil. The first scientific description of the pygmy corydoras was published in 1966 by German biologist and physician Joachim Knaack, in Aquarien und Terrarien-Zeitschrift.[2][3] One specimen was designated the holotype and one additional specimen was collected as a paratype.[2] The scientific name uses the Latin word pygmaeus, meaning dwarf or pygmy.[4] A species of Corydoras with a similar appearance, Corydoras hastatus was described in the 1880s, and many specimens that were described as Corydoras hastatus between the 1920s and 1950s were subsequently found to be misidentified specimens of the pygmy corydoras.[1] In older literature, the pygmy corydoras is frequently mislabeled due to Corydoras hastatus being the only miniature Corydoras species known at the time.[1] The pygmy corydoras is a silver-colored fish, with an unbroken black line that runs horizontally along the center of the sides of the fish from the tip of its snout to its caudal peduncle.[5] It has a second thin black line along the lower part of the side of the body, from behind the ventral fins and continuing into the tail.[5] The top part of the body has a light black or dark gray shading that starts on the top of its snout and ends at the tail.[5] Newly hatched fry have vertical stripes along the sides of their bodies that fade by the end of their first month, when the horizontal stripes of the adult fish begin to appear.[5] The maximum length of the species is about 3.2 centimeters (1.3\u00a0in),[6] but typical adult sizes are 1.9 centimeters (0.75\u00a0in) for males and 2.5 centimeters (1.0\u00a0in) for females.[1] In addition to their larger length, females are also rounder and broader than males, especially when they have eggs.[7] Young fry grow rapidly after hatching, reaching 13 millimeters (0.51\u00a0in) in six to eight weeks.[1] The pygmy corydoras is widely distributed in inland waters in Peru in tributaries of the Nanay River, in Ecuador in tributaries of the Aguarico River, and in western Brazil in tributaries of the Madeira River.[8] The holotype was obtained from Calama, Brazil, along the Madeira River near the mouth of the Ji-Paran\u00e1 River.[6] The pygmy corydoras lives in a tropical climate in water with a 6.0 - 8.0 pH,[9] a water hardness of 2 \u2013 25 dGH,[9] and a temperature range of 22\u201326\u00a0\u00b0C (72\u201379\u00a0\u00b0F).[9] It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. The pygmy corydoras lays approximately 100 eggs at a time.[9] The female holds 2\u20134 eggs at a time in a pouch formed by her pelvic fins while they are fertilized by the male, which takes about 30 seconds.[9] The female swims to a safe location with the fertilized eggs, where she attaches the sticky eggs to a surface, where they will remain.[9] It is a peaceful fish, shoaling fish and can be kept in a community aquarium of smaller fish species such as ember tetras. It can be fed most sinking foods, flakes, frozen food and sinking wafers. It can be kept with small shrimp and snails. In aquariums, they are often kept on fine grained substrate, such as sand. This enables them to dig through the substrate without injury to their barbels, which can often be lost in sharp substrates. They are often kept at a pH of between 6.5 and 7.0. They are schooling fish that are usually kept in groups of at least four and will also behave much more naturally in larger groups (10 or more). Unlike the larger more common Corydoras, they often swim in shoals around the mid water and lower regions of the tank. C. pygmaeus are peaceful fish which will not thrive with aggressive tankmates. They are perhaps best kept in a planted species tank, or with shrimp such as Neocaridina spp. They seem to do best when offered live foods in addition to prepared food items. Appropriate foods include microworms or similar nematodes, as well as Artemia nauplii (newly hatched brine shrimp)."

It originates in inland waters in South America, and is found in the Upper Orinoco River basin in Venezuela and Colombia. C. habrosus, is often found in periodic wetlands, large floodplains to where other species migrate seasonally. These small corydoras are prone to entrapment in receding waters, and populations can suffer during the dry season.[2] Their natural habitat tends to be abundant in leaf litter and plant life, providing ample cover to allow these fish to roam moderately freely. As a bottom dwelling species C. habrosus tends to stick to the lower regions of the river, however, on occasion corydoras will dart up to the water surface to take in air. They use their intestines as an air breathing organ to absorb oxygen, and expel the remnant air out of the anus.[3] The fish will grow in length up to 1.4 inches (3.5 centimeters). It lives in a tropical climate in water with a 5.5 \u2013 7.5 pH, a water hardness of 2 \u2013 10 dGH, and a temperature of about 77\u00a0\u00b0F (25\u00a0\u00b0C).[4] The diet consists of worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. It is a peaceful fish and can be kept in a community aquarium of smaller fish species such as ember tetras, clown panchax, endler guppies and small species of rasbora.  It should be kept in groups of at least 6 individuals, ideally 10 or more. A shoal should be kept in a tank that is at least 14 gallons in size.[5] Salt and pepper catfish can be fed most small sinking foods including pellets, flake food and preserved baby brine shrimp. Frozen foods such as baby brine shrimp, rotifers and cyclops can also be fed either regularly or exclusively. In captivity, breeding can be difficult to achieve. Some aquarists report that large water changes with relatively cold water can stimulate habrosus in to spawning.[6] Spawning is marked by obvious behaviours; males will swim close to the female, if multiple males are present they will surround the female swimming from side to side quickly. The female holds an egg visibly under her ventral fin ready for fertilising. The female can then be seen to 'massage' the males belly. The female will then choose an appropriate place to deposit her egg, usually on plants near the substrate, particularly on the underside of the leaves but can also be found on the aquarium glass and decor.  Eggs are rarely placed on the top of the leaves or close to the water surface. The spawning male will protect the female from other males attempting to spawn with her.

        "description": " Sterba's corydoras (Corydoras sterbai) is a member of the South American Corydoras genus of freshwater aquarium catfish and one of the most popular species of Corydoras due to its attractive markings. The fish is native to the Guapor\u00e9 River region between Bolivia and Brazil.[1] Sterba's cory is distinguishable from other Corydoras species as it has white spots on a black background on its head. It is occasionally confused with Corydoras haraldschultzi; the difference is that the latter has a pattern of black dots on a white background on the head.  C. sterbai has recently become available in an albino form and a black form. Like many Corydoras species, Sterba's corydoras is a shoaling catfish, and thus should ideally be kept in groups of 5 or more. In the wild it can be found in Brazil and thus, wild caught fish prefer soft, acidic water. However, Sterba's corydoras is a hardy fish and tank bred specimens have adapted to a wider range of water conditions. However, like almost all fish it will not tolerate high levels of nitrates. Unlike some other catfish they are not good algae eaters, but are good at \"cleaning up\" leftover food and detritus from the substrate. Corydoras sterbai are relatively small for catfish, growing to a maximum size of only 2\u20132.6 inches (5.1\u20136.6\u00a0cm). In captivity Corydoras sterbai readily accepts a wide variety of prepared and frozen foods. Flake food is a good staple diet (which will only be consumed once it has fallen to the bottom) as are sinking pellets or wafers. They relish live and frozen foods such as bloodworm, daphnia and mosquito larvae, but ideally should only be fed such foods once a week due to the high amount of protein in them. It is often problematic to feed Corydoras in aquaria with fast feeding mid-water fish such as tetras as flake and sinking pellets are consumed by such fish before they have hit the bottom and sometimes, even while lying on the substrate. However, this problem can be overcome by placing pellets and flake on the aquarium substrate in caves or under bogwood, or other such areas which are not regularly frequented by mid-water fish. The compatibility of C. sterbai is one of their main selling points as with all other Corydoras species as they are very peaceful catfish and can be kept with other peaceful fish. They should not be kept with overly aggressive bottom dwellers, particularly if there is competition over substrate space as there would be in small tanks or tanks with a large amount of \"furniture\". Ideal companions would be similar sized tetras or particularly, dwarf cichlids. Ideally Corydoras sterbai should be housed with a fine substrate such as sand or gravel in order to avoid doing damage to their delicate barbels. However, large gravel will suffice as long as it is not sharp edged. Their only other requirement is that shade be provided for them, by means of overhanging rock, large leaved plants, arching bogwood or caves. Breeding is not too difficult. A tank with dimensions 18\u2033 x 12\u2033 x 12\u2033 (10 US Gallon) is recommended. The breeding ratio that should be kept is 2 males per female. Good diet together with repeated water changes and drops of temperature are usually sufficient. However, raising the fry is not easy due to its high sensitivity. Occasionally problems can arise while transporting these fish as they are capable of secreting a chemical toxin when stressed or overcrowded. For this reason they are never shipped with other fish. The species name of this Corydoras is in honour of Professor Dr. G\u00fcnther Sterba, professor emeritus of zoology of Leipzig University, member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.[2] Professor Sterba is a professional ichthyologist who nevertheless produced several very popular books regarded as virtual bibles for fishkeepers over the 1970s and 1980s, translated into English under the titles Freshwater Fishes of the World, Aquarium Care and (with Dick Mills) The Aquarists' Encyclopedia, despite his degree of isolation at that time by virtue of living in the then German Democratic Republic."

It lives in a tropical climate in water with a 6\u20138 pH, a water hardness of 2\u201325 dGH, and a temperature range of 72\u201379\u00a0\u00b0F (22\u201326\u00a0\u00b0C).  It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter.  It lays eggs in dense vegetation and adults do not guard the eggs.  The female holds 2\u20134 eggs between her pelvic fins, where the male fertilizes them for about 30 seconds.  Only then does the female swim to a suitable spot, where she attaches the very sticky eggs. The pair repeats this process until about 100 eggs have been fertilized and attached.

        "description": " Corydoras julii (also known as the julii cory or leopard catfish[2]) is a small freshwater catfish native to eastern Brazil. It is often confused with Corydoras trilineatus,[3] the three stripe corydoras. Corydoras julii are small, peaceful shoaling fish, and are typically kept in groups in captivity.[4] Corydoras julii is a relatively small species of fish, growing to be no more than 52 millimeters in length.[5] Its skin is a translucent whitish-gray, with fine black spotting across the body and a horizontal stripe which reaches up the mid-body until it is equal with the front base of the dorsal fin. This spotting pattern is the primary visual difference between C. julii and three stripe corydoras (C. trilineatus), which have larger reticulations, as opposed to spots, and a longer mid-body stripe. C. julii might be further distinguished from C. trilineatus by the spotted pattern on its head; however, C. trilineatus can also show this pattern on occasion.[5] Females are typically larger and rounder than males.[6] Corydoras julii, like almost all Corydoras species, are bottom-feeding scavengers. Their diet consists primarily of small invertebrates which they sift from the substrate, expelling the particles of sand and sediment through their gill openings. In captivity, their diet is frequently sinking pellets rich in insect and other invertebrate proteins, as well as live or frozen invertebrates like bloodworms, daphnia, brine shrimp, and California blackworms (Lumbriculus variegatus).[4] After sexual maturity, Corydoras spawning appears to be triggered by storms.[6] During this storm, the fish eat increased amounts of insects. The water gradually decreases temperature over the course of a few days.[6] Corydoras fish breed in a position resembling a \"T formation\". In this formation, the female swims up to the male's abdomen, and consumes sperm released by the male. The sperm rapidly travels though the female's intestinal tract and fertilizes the eggs in the cloaca. Small, white, sturdy eggs are laid on plant leaves in the wild. Adult corydoras have been known to eat their own eggs.[6]"

It was originally described as Silurus callichthys by Linnaeus in 1758.[1] It is likely to represent a species complex.[2] C. callichthys is distributed in all major river drainages of South America.[2] It is very wide-ranging, extending from Trinidad to  Buenos Aires, Argentina, including the upper Amazon River and Paraguay River systems. The fish will grow in length up to eight inches (20 centimeters).  The females are larger and more robust, and are a dull olive-green, while the males are brighter in color, exhibiting a delicate blue or violet sheen laterally, with a more developed and longer pectoral fin spine that is reddish-brown and edged with orange or reddish-orange. It lives in a variety of water types, from anoxic conditions (slack water zones surrounded by dense vegetation) to slightly turbid, but free-flowing, streams.[1] It can be found in waters with pH range of 5.8 to 8.3, a water hardness of 0\u201330dGH, and a temperature range of 64\u201383\u00a0\u00b0F (18\u201328\u00a0\u00b0C).[1] When its biotype becomes dry, it can move out of the water, due to its ability to swallow air and use its intestines to absorb oxygen from the atmosphere, to find more water.[1] It feeds at night on fish, insects, and plant matter.  Juveniles feed on rotifers, in addition to the microcrustaceans and aquatic insect larvae they find when digging into the substrate.[1] During reproduction, the male's belly turns orange and its pectoral spines become longer and thicker.  The male builds a bubble nest with some floating plants, fiercely guarding it after the female lays down her eggs.[1] The cascarudo is of commercial importance in the aquarium trade industry and of minor importance as a food source.[1] It can be kept in aquariums, with groups of more than five individuals recommended.[1]"

        "description": " Megalechis thoracata (black marble hoplo, spotted hoplo[1]) is a species of catfish of the family Callichthyidae.  M. thoracata is found east of the Andes in the Amazon, Orinoco, and upper Paraguay River basins, as well as in the coastal rivers of the Guianas and northern Brazil. Recent introductions were recorded in the upper Paran\u00e1 River drainage.[2] Overview: The Spotted Hoplo Catfish is an incredibly hardy and relatively easy species to keep in captivity, with the main difficulty being the maximum size of around 6 inches, or 15\u00a0cm.They are a very peaceful fish, with the only exception being when the males are guarding a bubble nest at breeding time. They can be kept with almost all tankmates, but they will likely eat anything that can fit in their mouths due to their opportunistic nature. This rule also applies for larger fish, as the Hoplo may get eaten or have its barbels or fins damaged by large, potentially aggressive fish, such as South American Cichlids, African Cichlids, larger catfish and most larger fish species that can fit the Hoplo in its mouth or shows aggression. Tank Setup: They require a soft sand substrate, as they are bottom dwellers that can often be observed foraging/searching for food. A gentle substrate is essential, as other coarse grained or abrasive substrates can irritate the fish's sensitive barbels, and even cause them to fall off. To thrive in the aquarium, they need a minimum tank size of 55 US liquid gallons, but as a rule of thumb for this fish, the larger the tank, the better.[3][4] They are semi-social creatures that prefer to be kept in groups of at least five, but still seem content alone or in pairs. The spotted hoplo catfish needs hiding places, usually in the form of rocks, wood and plants, such as variations of Anubias, valisineria, java fern and micranthemum. Floating plants are also appreciated, as they provide extra cover. Water Conditions: Despite the Hoplo being a very hardy fish, like all fish they need a mature, cycled tank with the correct parameters for almost all tropical species. As they are a species of tropical fish, the optimal temperature for them is around 24\u201328 degrees Celsius, but they can adapt to temperatures in the 22\u201330 degrees Celsius range, although this is not recommended and over a long period of time this can lead to elevated stress levels, amongst other health concerns. The natural habitat of Megalechis thoracata is slow flowing, low oxygen parts of the  Amazon, Orinoco, and upper Paraguay River basins. For this reason, catfish of the family Callichthyidae among other fish, have developed a unique way of breathing, where the fish will rise to the surface of the water and ingest a small amount of air.[5] The oxygen is then absorbed through the lining of the stomach and intestine. This is known as gastrointestinal respiration. They will feed on small to medium-sized worms and other invertebrates, small fish, and general detritus. M. thoracata has been observed to produce sounds during territorial behavior in males at their nest sites and especially during spawning, and during aggressive behavior in both sexes. M. thoracata males aggressively defend territories against intruders.[6]"

        "description": " The emerald catfish  (Corydoras splendens) is a tropical freshwater fish belonging to the Corydoradinae sub-family of the family Callichthyidae native to the Amazon Basin in South America.[1] It has traditionally been known as Brochis splendens.[2] The fish has appeared on a stamp in Brazil.[3] It was originally described as Callichthys splendens by Fran\u00e7ois Louis de la Porte, comte de Castelnau in 1855.  This species was once also commonly called Brochis coeruleus. W. A. Gosline was the first to suspect that the two species were the same in 1940, but it was actually Njiseen & Isbr\u00fccker, in 1970, who combined the two, giving sufficient reasons for doing so. The species would be described as Brochis splendens, until most of the catfish formerly classified as Brochis were re-classified into Corydoras.[2] The current recognized classification is thus Corydoras splendens.[1] It is native to the upper reaches Amazon Basin.[1] This includes Ucayali River to Pucallpa, Ambiyacu River, and the area around Iquitos in western Brazil, southeastern Colombia, eastern Ecuador and eastern Peru. Depending upon the angle of lighting, the fish's body reflects a metallic green, blue-green, or even a bluish color.  The ventral area is yellowish with the pectoral, ventral, and anal fins yellowish and the dorsal, caudal, and adipose fins a translucent brownish.  The females are larger and more robust than the males, and have a more pinkish belly as opposed to the more yellowish one for the males. This fish can be distinguished from the green/bronze corydoras catfish by its usually larger size, stouter body, and more pointed snout. The fish inhabits sluggish waters with dense vegetation along the banks.[1] It occurs in shallow muddy waters and will grow in length up to 7.5\u00a0centimetres (3\u00a0in).[1] It lives in a tropical climate in water with a 5.8\u20138.0 pH, a water hardness of 2\u201330 dGH, and a temperature range of 22\u201328\u00a0\u00b0C (72\u201382\u00a0\u00b0F).[1] It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, and insect larvae. It lays eggs in dense vegetation and adults do not guard the eggs. The emerald catfish is a common species in freshwater aquaria.  It is a peaceful, undemanding species and can be maintained under the same conditions as most Corydoras species.  They are shy and easily frightened when kept as individuals, so it is best kept in small groups of at least three, with more being recommended.  The tank should have only a soft, fine bottom to prevent damage to barbels and should be heavily planted.[4] Feeding is not difficult and they accept almost anything, although live worms are especially appreciated.[5] It does well in a community tank and does not tear up the plants.[5] Spawning has been achieved in captivity.[4] Typically, the fish are separated into a breeding tank in the ratio of three males to two females, all well-conditioned on live foods.  The couple will spawn while sitting on the bottom, not while swimming as many similar species do. In captivity, the female collects the eggs in her pelvic fin basket and pastes them individually to plants and other objects.  Eggs will be deposited by the female throughout the tank, but especially on any floating surface plants.  According to most reports, the parents do not immediately try to eat the eggs.  The eggs hatch in about four days and the fry become free swimming two days later."

It is native to South America, and is found in the western Amazon basin in Ecuador and Peru. This species is traditionally placed in Brochis but the genus is a synonym of Corydoras.[1][2] FishBase continues to recognize Brochis as a valid genus.[3] The fish has about 17 dorsal fin rays as compared with the 11 or 12 commonly seen in Corydoras splendens. The snout is considerably longer than other species in the genus which explains the common name. The fish will grow in length up to 6.7 centimetres (2.6 inches).[citation needed] The hog-nosed catfish lives in a tropical climate in water with a 6.0\u20137.2 pH, a water hardness of 15 dGH, and a temperature range of 21\u201324\u00a0\u00b0C (70\u201375\u00a0\u00b0F).

        "description": " The banded corydoras or bearded catfish (Scleromystax barbatus) is a subtropical freshwater fish belonging to the subfamily Corydoradinae of the family Callichthyidae. It originates in coastal drainages in South America from Rio de Janeiro to Santa Catarina, Brazil.[2] It was originally described as Callichthys barbatus by Jean Ren\u00e9 Constant Quoy & Joseph Paul Gaimard in 1824, from which it was transferred to genus Corydoras as Corydoras barbatus, a name which by which it is still being referred to in the aquarium industry. The species was further transferred to genus Scleromystax in 2003.[3] The fish will grow in length up to 9.8\u00a0centimetres (3.9\u00a0in).[2] This species has pronounced sexual dimorphism. The dorsal and pectoral fins of males reach, or almost reach, the caudal peduncle, and well-developed odontodes are inserted in fleshy tissue on a large area on the sides of the snout in fully grown males.[4] The banded corydoras lives in a subtropical climate in water with a 6.0\u20138.0 pH, a water hardness of 2\u201325 dGH, and a temperature of 68\u00a0\u00b0F (20\u00a0\u00b0C) to 82\u00a0\u00b0F (28\u00a0\u00b0C).[2] It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. It lays eggs in dense vegetation and adults do not guard the eggs. In captivity, as the sperm are released the female sinks to the bottom, resting on one of her pectoral fins while she starts fanning with the other pectoral fin. At this time, some eggs are released which fall into the pelvic fin basket and are apparently fertilized at that time. The banded corydoras is of commercial importance in the aquarium trade industry. Though peaceful, they get larger than most Corydoras and are therefore less suitable for small aquaria.[5]  This Callichthyidae-related article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it."

        "description": " The bronze corydoras  (Corydoras aeneus), also known as the green corydoras, bronze catfish, lightspot corydoras or wavy catfish, is a species of freshwater fish in the armored catfish family, Callichthyidae, often kept as an aquarium fish. It is widely distributed in South America on the eastern side of the Andes, from Colombia and Trinidad to the R\u00edo de la Plata basin;[2] however, as presently defined it is a species complex and a taxonomic review is necessary.[3] It was originally described as Hoplosoma aeneum (based on a specimen from Trinidad) by Theodore Gill in 1858 and has historically also been referred to as Callichthys aeneus.[2] The adult size is 6\u00bd cm for males and a slightly larger 7\u00a0cm for females (2\u00bd to 2\u00be inches).[4]   Females have a slightly higher body frame than males in accordance with their larger abdominal region. Their average life span is 10 years. It has a yellow or pink body, white belly, and is blue-grey over its head and back. Its fins are yellow or pink and immaculate. In common with most Corydoras the dorsal, pectoral and adipose fins have an additional sharp barb and have a mild poison which causes fish which try to attack them to get stung. A brownish-orange patch is usually present on the head, just before the dorsal fin, and is its most distinctive feature when viewed from above in the stream. Their upper sides are often a greenish color, which is the reason another common name for this fish is the green corydoras. Like many other catfishes, females are larger than males in this species.[5] They are found in quiet, shallow waters with soft bottoms that can sometimes be heavily polluted by clouds of disturbed mud from the bottom, but it also inhabits running waters.[2] In its native habitat, it inhabits waters with a temperature range of 25\u00a0\u00b0C to 28\u00a0\u00b0C (77\u00a0\u00b0F to 82\u00a0\u00b0F), pH 6.0\u20138.0, and hardness 5 to 19 DGH.[2] Like most members of the genus Corydoras, these catfish have a unique method of coping with the low oxygen content that prevails in such environments. In addition to utilizing their gills like any other fish, they rapidly come to the surface of the water and draw air in through their mouth. This air is then absorbed through the wall of the intestine and any surplus air is expelled through the vent.[2] It typically stays in schools of 20 to 30 individuals.[2] It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter.[2] Reproduction occurs with the onset of the rainy season, which changes the water chemistry.[2] Females spawn 10\u201320 egg-clutches with multiple males at a time, but an entire egg clutch is inseminated by the sperm of a single male.[5] In laboratory observations, it was found that bronze corydoras have a unique method of insemination. When these fish reproduce, the male will present his abdomen to the female. The female will attach her mouth to the male's genital opening, creating the well-known \"T-position\" many Corydoras exhibit during courtship. The female will then drink the sperm. The sperm rapidly moves through her intestines and is discharged together with her eggs into a pouch formed by her pelvic fins. The female can then swim away and deposit the pouch somewhere else alone. Because the T-position is exhibited in other species than just C. aeneus, it is likely that they also exhibit this behavior.[6] In the wild, eggs are laid on waterweeds.[5] Males do not form territories or compete over females; interference between males might only happen when two males present their abdomens simultaneously. On the other hand, females do not choose between males. Mating is more or less random; therefore, male reproductive success is directly related to courtship frequency.[5] The eggs of C. aeneus exhibit a unique surface pattern with small villi-like protuberances which resemble attaching-filaments of teleost eggs. These structures allow the eggs to be adhesive and stick to a specific place or to each other. The presence of these structures may be related to the turbid habitat in which this species lives.[7] Bronze corydoras are probably the most popular Corydoras species.[8] It is annually bred and shipped in large quantities all over the world[9] It is easily bred and is produced in commercial quantities in the United States, Europe, and Singapore. Most of the available fish are therefore domestic strains. Wild imports are reported to be less easy to breed.[citation needed] They are a hardy and useful aquarium fish despite having a coloration that is by no means striking or unusual. Many aquarists are fascinated by the habits of these fish. They ceaselessly comb the bottom of the aquarium for food and therefore disturb it slightly, sending up detritus and waste material that has settled loosely on the bottom. They prefer being kept in groups of 5 or more, being sociable fish and are ideal fish for a community tank.[2] Other Corydoras species can be placed in the same aquarium, and despite the strong resemblance many species bear to one another, the species will tend to separate out and only move about among their own kind. Corydoras aeneus is not particular about the composition of the water. Adequate conditions are a temperature range of 20 to 28\u00a0\u00b0C (68 to 82\u00a0\u00b0F), pH of 6.0\u20138.0, and hardness of 2\u201330 DGH. The water should have no salt added to it.[8] A fairly dense growth of plants with a number of possible hiding places is greatly appreciated. Corys are easy to feed, they are omnivores eating all flake and pelleted food and also live and frozen foods. When it comes to sperm, then the female glues the eggs, only a few in number, to the chosen substrate and then (sometimes) quickly touches them with her mouth. After several acts of spawning, which span a total of two to three hours, one female will have produced up to 200 eggs. Frequently, two males are used for each female, as one male has difficulty fertilizing all the eggs. The eggs gradually grow darker in color, and just prior to hatching (ranging from three days at 28\u00a0\u00b0C to a week at 20\u00a0\u00b0C) they turn dark brown. The fry keep to the bottom of the tank, feeding on detritus and any fine foods available. The parents may spawn again within two to three weeks. The albino corydoras is an albino variety of the bronze corydoras that has been developed for the aquarium trade, with a pale pink or orange body and red eyes.  It is physically similar to normally-colored individuals, although some breeders report that the fry are a little slower to develop.[10] Others say that the albinos are practically blind and that the males are somewhat sterile, although this may be due to extensive inbreeding.[11] Albino bronze corydoras are frequently injected with bright dye (via a needle) and sold in aquariums. This controversial practice is known as \"painting\" or \"juicing\" fish."

        "description": " The dwarf corydoras (Corydoras hastatus), dwarf catfish, tail spot pygmy catfish, or micro catfish is a tropical freshwater fish belonging to the subfamily Corydoradinae of the family Callichthyidae.  It originates in inland waters in South America, and is found in the Amazon River and Paraguay River basins in Argentina, Bolivia, and Brazil.[1] The specific epithet hastatus means with a spear, in reference to the spearhead-like spot on the tail root. The body of Corydoras hastatus is typically more elongated than other Corydoras species.  Its body is a translucent white to olive color, with a thin dark stripe on the sides from behind the gill cover to the root of the tail, and a whitish belly.  It has a white crescent at the base of the tail surrounding a black spot.  The fish will grow in length up to 1.4 inches (3.5\u00a0cm), but 1.0 inch (2.5\u00a0cm) is more typical.  Males are smaller, more slender and have a more pointed dorsal fin than females. The dwarf corydoras lives in a (sub)tropical climate in water with a 6.0\u20138.0 pH, a water hardness of 5\u201319 dGH, and a temperature range of 68\u201382 F (20\u201328\u00a0\u00b0C).[1] It is found in ponds.[1] It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. They are found in the Paraguay River and Amazon River basins. C. hastatus lives among plants.[1] It is a schooling species.[1] It differs from most Corydoras species by preferring the midwater areas instead of the bottom, spending most of its time well off the bottom in areas of dense plants.  When it rests, it rests on the leaves of the plants.  Other Corydoras species with similar mid-water habits include C. habrosus and C. pygmaeus. The dwarf Corydoras maintains its position in a current by using rapid fin movements, especially with its pectoral fins. These rapid movements, combined with a high breathing rate, give the fish the appearance of being very \"nervous\" when compared with other fish. C. hastatus may even shoal with small characins. The fish lays its eggs in dense vegetation and the adults do not guard the eggs.  The female holds a single egg between her pelvic fins, where the male fertilizes them for about 30 seconds.  Only then does the female swim to a suitable spot, where she attaches the sticky egg. The pair repeats this process about every three minutes for from one to two hours with some 10- to 15-minute rests between egg releases.  Around 7 to 15 eggs are spawned in a single day, and spawning occurs on three to four consecutive days. A total of 30 to 60 eggs may be spawned by a single female over this period of time. The eggs hatch in three to nine days.  The fry are about 6\u00a0mm long at hatching, mostly translucent but sometimes with spots. In two months, the fry average about 18\u00a0mm in length.  The fry mature in six to eight months. The dwarf corydoras is of commercial importance in the aquarium trade industry.   Due to its small size, this fish can be kept in a relatively small aquarium; a 5-gallon (20 litre) tank is sufficient for a small school.  Since it is a schooling fish, it should only be kept in groups of at least six individuals.  It is a good community tank fish when kept with peaceful tankmates such as tetras, rasboras, and danios, but should not be kept with overly aggressive tankmates.  They have also been used as scavengers for fry tanks. The aquarium should be clean, well-aerated, and densely planted to provide hiding places.  A moderate current provided by a power filter or canister filter is appreciated.  The water should be slightly alkaline (pH about 7.6) within a temperature range of 24\u00b0 to 29\u00a0\u00b0C.  Although the fish is generally a mid-water dweller, a fine gravel or sand substrate should be provided since it will occasionally burrow. The fish will feed both in midwater or on a substrate, whether that substrate is a plant leaf, a broad rock, or the bottom of the tank.  It accepts most foods, including freeze-dried, flake, and frozen foods, although live foods are particularly appreciated. The methods of spawning this fish in the aquarium is similar to spawning most other Corydoras species.  The spawning tank can be as small as 2.5 gallons (10 L), but at least a 5-gallon (20 L) tank is recommended with aged water, a sponge filter and some plants.  Fish should be conditioned with large amounts of live foods such as Tubifex and whiteworms, during which time the females will become noticeably plumper.  Since C. hastatus may spawn as a school, the whole group can be conditioned for spawning at the same time, and for best results, there should be at least two males for every female. Spawning of well-conditioned fish may be initiated by the addition of cooler water.  During spawning, very little food is accepted, but the fish will immediately search for food after finishing.  It will typically attach its eggs to the plants in the aquarium, but if not enough plants are available, the sides of the aquarium may be used.  When the fry hatch, they can be fed newly hatched brine shrimp or microworms.  The parents may be ready to spawn again in a couple of weeks."

The fish's appearance is characterized by dark double longitudinal stripes. The dorsal fin is ornamented by a few gray dots, taking on an arching pattern in some individuals. The body has other gray and black markings on an olive background. Compared with other species of Corydoras, the body is not as tall in comparison to its length, and its eyes are set a bit lower. The fish will grow in length up to 5.1 centimetres (2.0 inches). It lives in a tropical climate in water with a 6.0 - 8.0 pH, a water hardness of 2 \u2013 25 dGH, and a temperature range of 22\u201326\u00a0\u00b0C (72\u201379\u00a0\u00b0F). It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. Though it lays eggs in dense vegetation, adults do not guard them. In captivity, the male is reportedly territorial during the prespawning activities while the female is usually hidden among the plant roots. Both sexes clean the underside of plant leaves. Eggs are fastened under the leaves and are also attached to roots of plants. The elegant corydoras is of commercial importance in the aquarium trade industry. It tends to swim in the upper levels of the aquarium, instead of at the bottom as is common with most species of Corydoras, and does not seem to disturb the sediment as much."

        "description": " Corydoras panda is a species of catfish belonging to the genus Corydoras, of the family Callichthyidae, and is a native member of the riverine fauna of South America.  It is found in Peru and Ecuador, most notably in the Hu\u00e1nuco region, where it inhabits the R\u00edo Aquas, the R\u00edo Amarillae, a tributary of the R\u00edo Pachitea, and the R\u00edo Ucayali river system. The species was first collected by Randolph H. Richards in 1968, and was named Corydoras panda by Nijssen and Isbr\u00fccker in 1971. The specific name is an allusion to the appearance of the fish, which possesses large black patches surrounding the eyes, reminiscent of those found on the giant panda. Accordingly, the common names for this fish, which is a popular aquarium species, are panda corydoras and panda catfish. Corydoras panda has an off-white to pinkish-orange ground colour, and when observed under certain lighting conditions, a faint greenish iridescence is present upon the flanks and the operculum. The fins of the fish match the body in ground colour, upon close inspection being seen to be hyaline or translucent with coloured fin rays, with the dorsal fin being marked by a conspicuous black blotch that covers almost the entire fin area. The caudal peduncle is marked with a black band, this black band encircling the caudal peduncle from dorsal to ventral surface. The adipose fin, supported by a small fin spine, sometimes contains black pigmentation. The head is the same ground colour as the body, with a black mask surrounding the eyes, descending vertically from the fontanel, over each eye, and ending in a triangular wedge immediately before the ventral surface of the head. The pectoral fins are positioned immediately behind the operculum, and are usually oriented horizontally when the fish is at rest, extended in a manner similar to the wings of an aeroplane. The pelvic fins are positioned upon the ventral surface of the fish, located some way behind the pectoral fins. The first ray of the dorsal fin emanates from the body at approximately its point of greatest elevation, and a vertical line drawn downwards from this point meets the attachment point of the pelvic fins. The anal fin is located far to the rear of the ventral surface of the body, the attachment point of the first fin ray being somewhat forward of the black caudal peduncle marking described above. In common with all other members of the family Callichthyidae, the body surface is covered, not with scales, but with bony plates known as scutes. The lines of demarcation between individual scutes can be seen upon close examination of this and almost all other Callichthyid fishes, and in the case of some specimens of this species, are highlighted by additional black pigment. The fish possesses, in common with almost all Corydoras species, three pairs of barbels\u2014one pair of maxillary barbels and two pairs of rictal barbels. A fully mature adult specimen of this species attains a standard length of 55 millimetres (2.1\u00a0inches): this is the length attained by mature females, which grow larger than mature males, and also possess more rounded body outlines. Corydoras panda inhabits clear river waters that are relatively fast-flowing, well-oxygenated, and flowing over substrates that may comprise soft sand or fine gravel. These rivers are usually well vegetated with assorted species of aquatic plants. The proximity of the home rivers of the fish to the Andes mountain range, and the replenishment of those rivers with meltwaters from Andean snows at higher altitudes, has led the fish to be adaptable to cooler temperatures than the norm for 'tropical' fishes\u2014the temperature range of the fish is 16\u00a0\u00b0C to 28\u00a0\u00b0C, though the fish exhibits a marked preference for the cooler regions of this temperature spectrum, particularly in captivity. Indeed, the fish can, for small time-periods, survive temperatures as low as 12\u00a0\u00b0C, though captive rearing at such low temperatures is ill-advised. The native waters of Corydoras panda are consequently mineral-deficient, with a neutral to slightly acid pH, and replication of such conditions in captivity are recommended for successful maintenance. Corydoras panda has a preference for cooler than normal waters when compared to many other popular tropical fish species. Because of this, those who keep C. panda in community aquarium setting must choose tankmates that share its preference for cooler temperatures of around 20\u00a0\u00b0C (68\u00a0\u00b0F) to 25\u00a0\u00b0C (77\u00a0\u00b0F).[2] Given the cleanliness of the fish's native waters, scrupulous attention to water quality in the aquarium is considerably more important for this fish than for the more domesticated Corydoras species such as C. paleatus or C. aeneus. Additionally, scrupulous attention to aquarium substrate cleanliness is a must, as the fish are intolerant of poor aquarium maintenance in this area, and succumb to stress and disease rapidly if their aquaria are not kept to a high standard. Despite this, the species remains highly popular with aquarists, upon account of the appearance of the fish, and its lively, vivacious behaviour in a well-planned aquarium setting. Like many other Corydoras species, the panda catfish is a highly gregarious fish, and in common with several other smaller Corydoras species such as C. habrosus and C. pygmaeus, manifests a distinct need for numerous companions of its own species in order to thrive, and can thus be described as being more avowedly social than some of the larger members of the genus. A minimum of eight individuals should be housed in the same aquarium, and if space permits, this number should be revised upwards, as the fish exhibits a very definite preference for grouping together with others of its species. They also associate themselves easily with the clown loach and school together in currents where sufficient numbers of their own species is lacking. An aquarium for this species should be well furnished, ideally with a mixture of live aquatic plants, and solid furnishings providing caves, sheltered areas and hiding places to give the fish security. Floating plants to provide additional areas of shade are also welcomed by the fish. Like all Corydoras species, the fish feeds primarily upon animal matter. The aquarist is advised, however, that the traditional use of Corydoras catfishes as putative 'scavengers' in an aquarium setting will be detrimental to the well-being of this species\u2014it requires high quality foods for long-term maintenance, and a varied diet. Ideally, the fish should be given live foods at least intermittently, and will dine enthusiastically upon such items as Bloodworms (larvae of Chironomus midges), Daphnia, cultivated Brine Shrimp (Atermia salina), and Tubifex worms. The last, however, should be cultivated in order to minimise the risk of introducing pathogenic organisms to the aquarium, as Tubifex live in unsanitary conditions in the wild. Freeze dried Tubifex may be preferable, as the risk of introduction of disease is eliminated. High quality flake foods are also appreciated, particularly those containing shrimp or other similar matter. The lifespan of Corydoras panda in the aquarium has not been systematically determined, but given the longevity of other Corydoras species in the aquarium, it is reasonable to assume that well-cared for specimens will enjoy a lifespan in excess of ten years, and frequently in excess of 15 years. Corydoras panda follows, with a few minor deviations, the standard model for breeding for the genus. Stimulus for breeding consists of the influx of cooler, oxygenated waters into their habitat, usually corresponding in the wild with the onset of the rainy season. However, while some Corydoras species require a temperature drop in the aquarium for spawning to be stimulated, in the case of Corydoras panda, the temperature drop appears to matter much less, as specimens have spawned in the aquarium without a temperature drop. The addition of new, clean, oxygenated water appears to be the primary stimulus for this species. In the wild, the appearance of new water courtesy of the rains is followed by an increase in the populations of assorted food organisms, and feeding upon these conditions the fishes for breeding. Once conditioned fish are stimulated into spawning, males begin chasing females energetically. Females begin developing eggs within their reproductive tracts, and when 'ripe' (laden with eggs), become receptive to the attentions of the males. Eventually, one male will succeed in courting a female, using his barbels to provide stimulation to the female, usually beginning with caresses of the female's caudal peduncle, followed by caresses of the fontanel and the front of the head. if the female is receptive, then the male positions himself before the female, so that the female's mouth is in close proximity with one of the male's pectoral fins. The male then clasps the female's barbels between the pectoral fin and the body, and this stimulates the female to press against the male's side. When seen from above, the fish form a 'T' shape when conjoined thus, hence the term 'T position' has become conventional in aquarium circles when describing the breeding of Corydoras catfishes. Once the male and female are in the 'T position', the pressing of the female against the male's body stimulates his release of sperm. Though the exact mechanism of fertilisation has yet to be scientifically documented, from the observations of aquarists who have been successful in breeding Corydoras catfishes, it seems likely that the female takes the male's sperm through her mouthparts, and directs them through the gills, in a current that carries the sperm to her pelvic fins. At this point, the female releases a single egg (occasionally two), and purses her pelvic fins in order to provide a receptacle for the freshly extruded egg, which is then fertilised. One difference observed between the adoption of the 'T position' in Corydoras panda, when compared to other Corydoras species, is that the exercise is frequently more acrobatic in appearance, with the 'T position' being adopted in mid-water, some distance above the substrate, rather than resting upon the substrate as is the case with the majority of other Corydoras. Once the female is carrying a fertilised egg within her pelvic fins, she then seeks an egg deposition site. The choice of such a site is frequently, though not always, a mass of fine leaved aquatic vegetation. In the aquarium, the plant known as Java moss, Vesicularia dubayana, is of considerable utility as an egg repository for Corydoras catfishes, even though the plant is not a South American native, and panda catfish females will choose large clumps of this plant readily as safe deposition sites for fertilised eggs. The female is frequently pursued by one or more males as she seeks the deposition site, each male presumably seeking to be the chosen mate to fertilise the next egg. Up to 25 eggs may be produced by a single female during a single spawning, which may take place over four to five hours. Fertile Corydoras panda eggs require approximately 3\u20134 days development time before hatching, if kept at a temperature of 22\u00a0\u00b0C. This development time will vary with temperature, taking longer in cooler water. Upon hatching, the fry are four millimetres long, translucent, but already possessing the basic ground colour of the species, and upon close examination, possess fully formed barbels. Even newly hatched fry possess at least some hint of the adult eye patches, and as the fry grow, these patches darken and become more prominent. Even so, at just four millimetres in length, the fry are practically invisible against typical aquarium gravel unless seen to move. The fry take approximately four weeks to develop to the point where the finfold, a continuous undifferentiated membrane resembling that seen at the posterior of a tadpole, has differentiated into the unpaired fins (dorsal, anal and caudal fins). During this time, size will have increased to approximately eight or nine millimetres, and the fish will begin to develop colour changes leading to that of the adult fish. From this point, the caudal peduncle patch and dorsal fin patch will begin to appear, but the body will also be seen to be covered in fine black 'pepper dots' between these black patches. Only after a period of 10 to 12 weeks, at which point the fish has assumed a size of 12 to 14 millimetres, will the fish attain the colouration of the adult, and be in all respects a perfect miniature of the parents. Fry of this species are particularly sensitive to changes in water chemistry and to elevated temperatures. While adult fishes can withstand temperatures of 28\u00a0\u00b0C, fry will die of heat stress if exposed to temperatures above 26\u00a0\u00b0C, and their chances of survival are enhanced if the water temperature is kept at 22\u00a0\u00b0C or below. Water changes made to a nursery aquarium during the first 21 days of life of the fry\u2014the critical period during which they manifest the greatest sensitivity to their environment\u2014must be gradual, and the incoming water conditioned to match that of the existing aquarium water where possible before the water change takes place. While the fry are likely to develop best if given infusoria as part of their feeding r\u00e9gime, it is possible to raise fry to adulthood entirely upon prepared foods."

        "description": " Corydoras paleatus is a species of catfish (order Siluriformes) of the family Callichthyidae. Its common names include blue leopard corydoras, mottled corydoras, and peppered catfish.[1] It originates from the lower Paran\u00e1 River basin and coastal rivers in Uruguay and Brazil.[1] This fish species reach about 5.9 - 7 centimeters (2.3 - 2.75 \u00a0in) SL.[1] The male is smaller than the female, and in proportion to body length, the dorsal fin and pectoral fins are longer on the male than the female.[2] Corydoras paleatus is found in the Amazon basin,[1] and feeds on worms, crustaceans, insects, and plant matter.[1] C. paleatus has been known to produce sound; it does this by the abduction of its pectoral fins. This is used by males during courtship and intrapersonal communication, and by both sexes and juveniles when distressed.[2] In reproduction, males do not behave aggressively toward each other, nor do they monopolize mating areas or females.[2] The T-position is involved in courtship, as with many other Corydoras species.[2] Charles Darwin discovered the C. paleatus when he went to Buenos Aires during his expedition aboard the Beagle during the 1830s.[3] It is a very good choice for the community aquarium, as it is a hardy,[4] good-looking, and peaceful fish.[4] They can be successfully kept with other small, peaceful aquarium fish like livebearers, danios, and tetras. It is sometimes seen in the shops as an albino form, although this is similar to other albino corys (see the C. aeneus albino form). It grows to around 7.5\u00a0cm and is easily bred at home. These fish prefer a planted tank with temperatures around 16 to 24 \u00b0C (61 \u2013 75 \u00b0F), although they can take lower temperatures than this as it originates from colder waters.[3] Their high temperature tolerance seems poor, and 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F) is the highest safe temperature. They like to nibble on the algae that grow on floating plants but are not specialized algae-eating catfish. The lighting must not be too bright, and hiding places, such as bogwood, are needed as they like to hide from the light during certain parts of the day. Heavily planted areas should also be provided, where the light is minimized, as they like darker areas due to their bottom-feeding nature. Diet should be sinking pellets, algae wafers, frozen and live food, such as bloodworm or daphnia. They may also occasionally enjoy blanched spinach, which can be attached to plants with a peg or the side of the glass with magnetic clips. They can be seen to dart to the top of the tank: this is because they can use atmospheric oxygen to supplement what their gills extract from the water.[5] They will do this more frequently  when water quality is starting to deteriorate, and so should be watched for this indication. Peppered corydoras reach their sexual maturity and start to show reproductive behaviors once the females reach an average (minimum) size of 5.625 cm (2.214 inches) and once the males reach about 4.875 cm (1.919 inches).[citation needed] The males initiate the courtship ritual, which entails chasing the females around the tank. The female darts away, and the males search for her and find her a few moments later. The males shiver all over the female and may lie down on top of her. When she is ready to spawn, she turns to the male next to her and pounds below his ventral fin. The pair go into the \"T-position\" with the male releasing the sperm into the female's mouth before the sperm fertilizes the eggs[citation needed]. The female cups her ventral fins and lays a few eggs (usually between 4 and 12 eggs[citation needed]) in her fins.  The eggs are about 1.8 mm in diameter[citation needed]. The female now starts cleaning a spot on the glass to put her eggs on. Corydoras are egg depositors and lay their eggs all over the aquarium. Favorite spots include the heater, filters, and the glass, although, occasionally eggs are also laid on plants and driftwood. After depositing a group of eggs closely together, the female rests for a few moments. The males regroup and start chasing each other and then resume chasing the female. The males are so relentless in this pursuit that they try to mate with the female even while she is busy laying her eggs. The spawning lasts more than an hour, and many eggs are laid in different places. On average, about 50 to 150 eggs are laid during a single spawning[citation needed]. The incubation period for the eggs for peppered corydoras was found to be between 96 hours and 113 hours at 24\u00b12\u00b0C, with the average incubation period being about 102 hours (or 4.25 days)[citation needed]. In one study, the average hatching ratio of the eggs was found to be approximately 87%, with the overall egg-laying period lasting between 20 and 35 days[citation needed]. Peppered cories can eat their eggs, but will not eat the living fry.  At first, the fry is small (with a mean length of 7.5246 mm[citation needed]) and is unable to eat, sustaining themselves on the last of their yolk sacs. The fry will begin to eat 1\u20133 days after hatching, and will eat the protozoan organisms in the tank and can be fed powdered food at this stage.  By about one month, the fry will start to become rounder and will begin developing adult coloration, eventually becoming miniature versions of the adults[citation needed]. The juveniles will reach adult size at around 1 year of age, although this varies between individuals and how well they are kept. The age of sexual maturity also varies between individuals, but juveniles will typically begin breeding at around 8\u201312 months of age. However, they can begin as early as 6 months and as late as 18 months of age. From the onset of sexual maturity, it can take the fish up to another year to successfully produce fertile eggs; at first, entire clutches of eggs may be infertile. Albino strains may develop slower and be less fertile due to inbreeding. Media related to Corydoras paleatus at Wikimedia Commons"

        "description": " Corydoras pygmaeus, or the pygmy corydoras or pygmy catfish[1] is a tropical and freshwater fish belonging to the subfamily Corydoradinae of the family Callichthyidae. It originates in tropical inland waters in South America, and is found in the Madeira River basin in Brazil. The first scientific description of the pygmy corydoras was published in 1966 by German biologist and physician Joachim Knaack, in Aquarien und Terrarien-Zeitschrift.[2][3] One specimen was designated the holotype and one additional specimen was collected as a paratype.[2] The scientific name uses the Latin word pygmaeus, meaning dwarf or pygmy.[4] A species of Corydoras with a similar appearance, Corydoras hastatus was described in the 1880s, and many specimens that were described as Corydoras hastatus between the 1920s and 1950s were subsequently found to be misidentified specimens of the pygmy corydoras.[1] In older literature, the pygmy corydoras is frequently mislabeled due to Corydoras hastatus being the only miniature Corydoras species known at the time.[1] The pygmy corydoras is a silver-colored fish, with an unbroken black line that runs horizontally along the center of the sides of the fish from the tip of its snout to its caudal peduncle.[5] It has a second thin black line along the lower part of the side of the body, from behind the ventral fins and continuing into the tail.[5] The top part of the body has a light black or dark gray shading that starts on the top of its snout and ends at the tail.[5] Newly hatched fry have vertical stripes along the sides of their bodies that fade by the end of their first month, when the horizontal stripes of the adult fish begin to appear.[5] The maximum length of the species is about 3.2 centimeters (1.3\u00a0in),[6] but typical adult sizes are 1.9 centimeters (0.75\u00a0in) for males and 2.5 centimeters (1.0\u00a0in) for females.[1] In addition to their larger length, females are also rounder and broader than males, especially when they have eggs.[7] Young fry grow rapidly after hatching, reaching 13 millimeters (0.51\u00a0in) in six to eight weeks.[1] The pygmy corydoras is widely distributed in inland waters in Peru in tributaries of the Nanay River, in Ecuador in tributaries of the Aguarico River, and in western Brazil in tributaries of the Madeira River.[8] The holotype was obtained from Calama, Brazil, along the Madeira River near the mouth of the Ji-Paran\u00e1 River.[6] The pygmy corydoras lives in a tropical climate in water with a 6.0 - 8.0 pH,[9] a water hardness of 2 \u2013 25 dGH,[9] and a temperature range of 22\u201326\u00a0\u00b0C (72\u201379\u00a0\u00b0F).[9] It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. The pygmy corydoras lays approximately 100 eggs at a time.[9] The female holds 2\u20134 eggs at a time in a pouch formed by her pelvic fins while they are fertilized by the male, which takes about 30 seconds.[9] The female swims to a safe location with the fertilized eggs, where she attaches the sticky eggs to a surface, where they will remain.[9] It is a peaceful fish, shoaling fish and can be kept in a community aquarium of smaller fish species such as ember tetras. It can be fed most sinking foods, flakes, frozen food and sinking wafers. It can be kept with small shrimp and snails. In aquariums, they are often kept on fine grained substrate, such as sand. This enables them to dig through the substrate without injury to their barbels, which can often be lost in sharp substrates. They are often kept at a pH of between 6.5 and 7.0. They are schooling fish that are usually kept in groups of at least four and will also behave much more naturally in larger groups (10 or more). Unlike the larger more common Corydoras, they often swim in shoals around the mid water and lower regions of the tank. C. pygmaeus are peaceful fish which will not thrive with aggressive tankmates. They are perhaps best kept in a planted species tank, or with shrimp such as Neocaridina spp. They seem to do best when offered live foods in addition to prepared food items. Appropriate foods include microworms or similar nematodes, as well as Artemia nauplii (newly hatched brine shrimp)."

        "description": " The salt and pepper catfish (Corydoras habrosus) is a tropical freshwater fish belonging to the Corydoradinae sub-family of the family Callichthyidae. It originates in inland waters in South America, and is found in the Upper Orinoco River basin in Venezuela and Colombia. C. habrosus, is often found in periodic wetlands, large floodplains to where other species migrate seasonally. These small corydoras are prone to entrapment in receding waters, and populations can suffer during the dry season.[2] Their natural habitat tends to be abundant in leaf litter and plant life, providing ample cover to allow these fish to roam moderately freely. As a bottom dwelling species C. habrosus tends to stick to the lower regions of the river, however, on occasion corydoras will dart up to the water surface to take in air. They use their intestines as an air breathing organ to absorb oxygen, and expel the remnant air out of the anus.[3] The fish will grow in length up to 1.4 inches (3.5 centimeters). It lives in a tropical climate in water with a 5.5 \u2013 7.5 pH, a water hardness of 2 \u2013 10 dGH, and a temperature of about 77\u00a0\u00b0F (25\u00a0\u00b0C).[4] The diet consists of worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. It is a peaceful fish and can be kept in a community aquarium of smaller fish species such as ember tetras, clown panchax, endler guppies and small species of rasbora.  It should be kept in groups of at least 6 individuals, ideally 10 or more. A shoal should be kept in a tank that is at least 14 gallons in size.[5] Salt and pepper catfish can be fed most small sinking foods including pellets, flake food and preserved baby brine shrimp. Frozen foods such as baby brine shrimp, rotifers and cyclops can also be fed either regularly or exclusively. In captivity, breeding can be difficult to achieve. Some aquarists report that large water changes with relatively cold water can stimulate habrosus in to spawning.[6] Spawning is marked by obvious behaviours; males will swim close to the female, if multiple males are present they will surround the female swimming from side to side quickly. The female holds an egg visibly under her ventral fin ready for fertilising. The female can then be seen to 'massage' the males belly. The female will then choose an appropriate place to deposit her egg, usually on plants near the substrate, particularly on the underside of the leaves but can also be found on the aquarium glass and decor.  Eggs are rarely placed on the top of the leaves or close to the water surface. The spawning male will protect the female from other males attempting to spawn with her.

        "description": " Sterba's corydoras (Corydoras sterbai) is a member of the South American Corydoras genus of freshwater aquarium catfish and one of the most popular species of Corydoras due to its attractive markings. The fish is native to the Guapor\u00e9 River region between Bolivia and Brazil.[1] Sterba's cory is distinguishable from other Corydoras species as it has white spots on a black background on its head. It is occasionally confused with Corydoras haraldschultzi; the difference is that the latter has a pattern of black dots on a white background on the head.  C. sterbai has recently become available in an albino form and a black form. Like many Corydoras species, Sterba's corydoras is a shoaling catfish, and thus should ideally be kept in groups of 5 or more. In the wild it can be found in Brazil and thus, wild caught fish prefer soft, acidic water. However, Sterba's corydoras is a hardy fish and tank bred specimens have adapted to a wider range of water conditions. However, like almost all fish it will not tolerate high levels of nitrates. Unlike some other catfish they are not good algae eaters, but are good at \"cleaning up\" leftover food and detritus from the substrate. Corydoras sterbai are relatively small for catfish, growing to a maximum size of only 2\u20132.6 inches (5.1\u20136.6\u00a0cm). In captivity Corydoras sterbai readily accepts a wide variety of prepared and frozen foods. Flake food is a good staple diet (which will only be consumed once it has fallen to the bottom) as are sinking pellets or wafers. They relish live and frozen foods such as bloodworm, daphnia and mosquito larvae, but ideally should only be fed such foods once a week due to the high amount of protein in them. It is often problematic to feed Corydoras in aquaria with fast feeding mid-water fish such as tetras as flake and sinking pellets are consumed by such fish before they have hit the bottom and sometimes, even while lying on the substrate. However, this problem can be overcome by placing pellets and flake on the aquarium substrate in caves or under bogwood, or other such areas which are not regularly frequented by mid-water fish. The compatibility of C. sterbai is one of their main selling points as with all other Corydoras species as they are very peaceful catfish and can be kept with other peaceful fish. They should not be kept with overly aggressive bottom dwellers, particularly if there is competition over substrate space as there would be in small tanks or tanks with a large amount of \"furniture\". Ideal companions would be similar sized tetras or particularly, dwarf cichlids. Ideally Corydoras sterbai should be housed with a fine substrate such as sand or gravel in order to avoid doing damage to their delicate barbels. However, large gravel will suffice as long as it is not sharp edged. Their only other requirement is that shade be provided for them, by means of overhanging rock, large leaved plants, arching bogwood or caves. Breeding is not too difficult. A tank with dimensions 18\u2033 x 12\u2033 x 12\u2033 (10 US Gallon) is recommended. The breeding ratio that should be kept is 2 males per female. Good diet together with repeated water changes and drops of temperature are usually sufficient. However, raising the fry is not easy due to its high sensitivity. Occasionally problems can arise while transporting these fish as they are capable of secreting a chemical toxin when stressed or overcrowded. For this reason they are never shipped with other fish. The species name of this Corydoras is in honour of Professor Dr. G\u00fcnther Sterba, professor emeritus of zoology of Leipzig University, member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.[2] Professor Sterba is a professional ichthyologist who nevertheless produced several very popular books regarded as virtual bibles for fishkeepers over the 1970s and 1980s, translated into English under the titles Freshwater Fishes of the World, Aquarium Care and (with Dick Mills) The Aquarists' Encyclopedia, despite his degree of isolation at that time by virtue of living in the then German Democratic Republic."

        "description": " Corydoras julii (also known as the julii cory or leopard catfish[2]) is a small freshwater catfish native to eastern Brazil. It is often confused with Corydoras trilineatus,[3] the three stripe corydoras. Corydoras julii are small, peaceful shoaling fish, and are typically kept in groups in captivity.[4] Corydoras julii is a relatively small species of fish, growing to be no more than 52 millimeters in length.[5] Its skin is a translucent whitish-gray, with fine black spotting across the body and a horizontal stripe which reaches up the mid-body until it is equal with the front base of the dorsal fin. This spotting pattern is the primary visual difference between C. julii and three stripe corydoras (C. trilineatus), which have larger reticulations, as opposed to spots, and a longer mid-body stripe. C. julii might be further distinguished from C. trilineatus by the spotted pattern on its head; however, C. trilineatus can also show this pattern on occasion.[5] Females are typically larger and rounder than males.[6] Corydoras julii, like almost all Corydoras species, are bottom-feeding scavengers. Their diet consists primarily of small invertebrates which they sift from the substrate, expelling the particles of sand and sediment through their gill openings. In captivity, their diet is frequently sinking pellets rich in insect and other invertebrate proteins, as well as live or frozen invertebrates like bloodworms, daphnia, brine shrimp, and California blackworms (Lumbriculus variegatus).[4] After sexual maturity, Corydoras spawning appears to be triggered by storms.[6] During this storm, the fish eat increased amounts of insects. The water gradually decreases temperature over the course of a few days.[6] Corydoras fish breed in a position resembling a \"T formation\". In this formation, the female swims up to the male's abdomen, and consumes sperm released by the male. The sperm rapidly travels though the female's intestinal tract and fertilizes the eggs in the cloaca. Small, white, sturdy eggs are laid on plant leaves in the wild. Adult corydoras have been known to eat their own eggs.[6]"

It was originally described as Silurus callichthys by Linnaeus in 1758.[1] It is likely to represent a species complex.[2] C. callichthys is distributed in all major river drainages of South America.[2] It is very wide-ranging, extending from Trinidad to  Buenos Aires, Argentina, including the upper Amazon River and Paraguay River systems. The fish will grow in length up to eight inches (20 centimeters).  The females are larger and more robust, and are a dull olive-green, while the males are brighter in color, exhibiting a delicate blue or violet sheen laterally, with a more developed and longer pectoral fin spine that is reddish-brown and edged with orange or reddish-orange. It lives in a variety of water types, from anoxic conditions (slack water zones surrounded by dense vegetation) to slightly turbid, but free-flowing, streams.[1] It can be found in waters with pH range of 5.8 to 8.3, a water hardness of 0\u201330dGH, and a temperature range of 64\u201383\u00a0\u00b0F (18\u201328\u00a0\u00b0C).[1] When its biotype becomes dry, it can move out of the water, due to its ability to swallow air and use its intestines to absorb oxygen from the atmosphere, to find more water.[1] It feeds at night on fish, insects, and plant matter.  Juveniles feed on rotifers, in addition to the microcrustaceans and aquatic insect larvae they find when digging into the substrate.[1] During reproduction, the male's belly turns orange and its pectoral spines become longer and thicker.  The male builds a bubble nest with some floating plants, fiercely guarding it after the female lays down her eggs.[1] The cascarudo is of commercial importance in the aquarium trade industry and of minor importance as a food source.[1] It can be kept in aquariums, with groups of more than five individuals recommended.[1]"

        "description": " Megalechis thoracata (black marble hoplo, spotted hoplo[1]) is a species of catfish of the family Callichthyidae.  M. thoracata is found east of the Andes in the Amazon, Orinoco, and upper Paraguay River basins, as well as in the coastal rivers of the Guianas and northern Brazil. Recent introductions were recorded in the upper Paran\u00e1 River drainage.[2] Overview: The Spotted Hoplo Catfish is an incredibly hardy and relatively easy species to keep in captivity, with the main difficulty being the maximum size of around 6 inches, or 15\u00a0cm.They are a very peaceful fish, with the only exception being when the males are guarding a bubble nest at breeding time. They can be kept with almost all tankmates, but they will likely eat anything that can fit in their mouths due to their opportunistic nature. This rule also applies for larger fish, as the Hoplo may get eaten or have its barbels or fins damaged by large, potentially aggressive fish, such as South American Cichlids, African Cichlids, larger catfish and most larger fish species that can fit the Hoplo in its mouth or shows aggression. Tank Setup: They require a soft sand substrate, as they are bottom dwellers that can often be observed foraging/searching for food. A gentle substrate is essential, as other coarse grained or abrasive substrates can irritate the fish's sensitive barbels, and even cause them to fall off. To thrive in the aquarium, they need a minimum tank size of 55 US liquid gallons, but as a rule of thumb for this fish, the larger the tank, the better.[3][4] They are semi-social creatures that prefer to be kept in groups of at least five, but still seem content alone or in pairs. The spotted hoplo catfish needs hiding places, usually in the form of rocks, wood and plants, such as variations of Anubias, valisineria, java fern and micranthemum. Floating plants are also appreciated, as they provide extra cover. Water Conditions: Despite the Hoplo being a very hardy fish, like all fish they need a mature, cycled tank with the correct parameters for almost all tropical species. As they are a species of tropical fish, the optimal temperature for them is around 24\u201328 degrees Celsius, but they can adapt to temperatures in the 22\u201330 degrees Celsius range, although this is not recommended and over a long period of time this can lead to elevated stress levels, amongst other health concerns. The natural habitat of Megalechis thoracata is slow flowing, low oxygen parts of the  Amazon, Orinoco, and upper Paraguay River basins. For this reason, catfish of the family Callichthyidae among other fish, have developed a unique way of breathing, where the fish will rise to the surface of the water and ingest a small amount of air.[5] The oxygen is then absorbed through the lining of the stomach and intestine. This is known as gastrointestinal respiration. They will feed on small to medium-sized worms and other invertebrates, small fish, and general detritus. M. thoracata has been observed to produce sounds during territorial behavior in males at their nest sites and especially during spawning, and during aggressive behavior in both sexes. M. thoracata males aggressively defend territories against intruders.[6]"

        "description": " Ancistrus is a genus of nocturnal freshwater fish in the family Loricariidae of order Siluriformes, native to freshwater habitats in South America and Panama. Fish of this genus are common in the aquarium trade where they are known as bushynose or bristlenose catfish. In the aquarium hobby they are often referred to as bushynose or bristlenose plecos instead, but this may lead to confusion as \"pleco\" usually is used for Hypostomus plecostomus and its allies and is often used as a catchall term for any loricariids remotely resembling that species. The type species is Ancistrus cirrhosus.[1] This genus is the largest genus within the tribe Ancistrini.[2] The name ancistrus derives from the Ancient Greek agkistron \"hook\"\u00a0\u2013 a reference to the form of the cheek odontodes. The genera Pristiancistrus, Thysanocara and Xenocara are now synonyms of Ancistrus.[2] Ancistrus species show all the typical features of the Loricariidae. This includes a body covered in bony plates and a ventral suckermouth.[3] The feature most commonly associated with the genus are the fleshy tentacles found on the head in adult males; females may possess tentacles along the snout margin but they are smaller and they lack tentacles on the head.[3] Tentacules, tentacles directly associated with odontodes, develop on the pectoral fin spine of the males of some species.[3] Males also have evertible cheek odontodes which are less developed or absent in females. They also lack odontodes along the snout.[2] In comparison with a typical loricariid (pleco), a bristlenose is typically shorter (4\u20136 inches or 15\u00a0cm or less), more flattened and fatter with a comparatively wider head. Colouration is typically mottled brown, grey or black. Small white or yellow spots are common.[2] In contrast to many other loricariid 'plecos' (many of which regularly exceed a foot in captivity), the bristlenose plecos do not usually exceed six inches in length; they can thus be kept in relatively small tanks, contributing to their popularity in the aquarium hobby. Ancistrus species are unusual among vertebrates in possessing an X0 sex-determination system, which is the prevailing method in many lineages of arthropod but is very rare elsewhere in the animal kingdom.[4] Ancistrus is one of the widest ranging Loricariid genera, and representatives are found in most areas where the family in general is present.[2] Many species are found in the rivers and floodplain areas of the Amazon basin, but there are also species elsewhere in tropical South America, as well as species on the island of Trinidad and two species, A. centrolepis and A. chagresi in Panama.[5] Three species are true cavefish (troglobites): A. cryptophthalmus, A. galani and A. formoso.[6][7] These are the only known loricariids that possess adaptions for a subterranean lifestyle, such as reduced pigmentation (appearing overall whitish) and eyes.[6] In the wild, Ancistrus species prefer flowing water, so tanks with flow are typically used when keeping them in captivity. Since they are bottom-dwelling fish, substrate is considered preferable to a bare tank floor. Mixtures of gravel, dirt, and clay are frequently used as substrate for Ancistrus. The aquarium size that is considered by some to be a minimum for fish of this genus is 25 gallons.[8] There are currently 76 recognized species in this genus:[9] The diet of this genus is typical for a Loricariid\u00a0\u2013 algae, aufwuchs, and detritus, with sediment, sand, and gravel presumably ingested accidentally alongside food items.[13][14][15][16][17][18] Despite reports among fish-keepers that they require wood in their diet, no scientific evidence to date supports members of this genus feeding on wood.  Bristlenoses do not school but hide when not feeding, juveniles however are typically found in brightly lit shallows at the water margin making them susceptible to predation by birds. Ancistrus species have the capability of obtaining oxygen through their modified stomach.[19] This allows them to survive in conditions with low oxygen levels.[2] Breeding takes place in hollows, caves and mud holes in banks. Males may clean the inside of the cavity with their suckermouth before allowing the female to approach and inspect the nest.  Courtship includes expanding the dorsal and caudal fins and attempts by the male to escort the female to the nest. While the female inspects the nest, the male keeps close contact.[3] The female may lay 20\u2013200 adhesive eggs, usually to the ceiling of the cavity.[3] The female plays no role in parental care; the male takes care of its young. Males will clean the eggs and the cavity with its fins and mouth. Males inspect eggs to remove diseased or infertile eggs, and aerates the clutch by fanning them with its pectoral and pelvic fins.[3] During this time, a male usually will not leave the cavity to feed, or will leave only occasionally and quickly return.[3] The eggs hatch in 4\u201310 days over a period of 2\u20136 hours; the male guards the eggs for 7\u201310 days after hatching.[3] The fry remain in the cave, attaching to the walls and ceiling with their mouths, absorbing their yolk sac in 2\u20134 days and becoming free swimming.[3] Males of these species are competitive and territorial. Males display to each other by positioning themselves parallel to each other, head to tail, with dorsal and caudal fins erect and cheek odontode spines everted. If this escalates to combat, the males will circle each other and direct attacks at the head.[3] If an intruding male manages to evict another male from the nest, it may cannibalize the other male's young.[3] A male bristlenose may guard several clutches of eggs simultaneously. Females prefer males that are already protecting eggs and may prefer males that are protecting larvae; it has been suggested that the tentacles may act as a fry mimic to attract females, which would allow males without eggs in their nest to compete with males guarding eggs.[3] Several clutches in various states of development from eggs to free-swimming larvae can be found in one nest.[2] These fish are often kept by aquarists, as they are dutiful algae-eaters and smaller in adult size than the common plecos usually seen in pet shops. They reach up to 15\u00a0cm in males, and 12\u00a0cm in females. Their recommended temperature is 23\u201327 degrees Celsius. Their lifespan is up to 12 years. They are hardy animals, tolerant to a wide range of water conditions. They breed easily in captivity, and are compatible with most other freshwater fish. Though typically mottled brown or black-and-grey spotted in color, other species are more exotic\u00a0\u2013 spots of bright yellow on a dark background being a common pattern. Albino variants are also common. The albino morph is not caused by exposure to light during development, it is a morph controlled by genetics.[20] Historically, commonly available species of Ancistrus were Ancistrus cirrhosus and Ancistrus temminckii; other species are now available, though exact identification is difficult. Feeding is easy, bristlenoses will graze on algae/ algae wafers and other surface growing organisms as well as eating algae wafers or tablets, flake food, squash, spinach, cucumber, zucchini, green beans peas and even sliced carrots. They have also been known to accept frozen bloodworms as part of their diet. Aquarium specimens may starve for lack of algae or other plant matter; algae wafers or other low-protein foods are recommended. Keepers should watch for the abdomen to take on a sunken appearance, indicating insufficient nutrition. Sexing is very easy as the female will only occasionally have bristles, around the edge of the chin, whereas the male will have them up the center of the head. Breeding is also possible. Males attract females to a small cave or hollow, then guard eggs after fertilization through hatching (4\u20138 days) until fry are free swimming (4\u20136 days after hatching); the aquarist need only supply a suitable cave, food, and one of each sex. Caution should be taken with the spines (odontodes)\u00a0; although the risk of personal injury is small with this genus, the hooked nature of the odontodes means that a bristlenose may become trapped in non-natural material such as sponge filters and netting."

They inhabit flowing sections of rivers, especially clearwater, in the basins of the Amazon (notably Trombetas, Tapaj\u00f3s, Xingu and Tocantins) and Orinoco (notably Ventuari) in Brazil and Venezuela. The largest species reach up to 34\u00a0cm (13\u00a0in) in total length.[2] Most Baryancistrus are differentiated from other related genera by a membrane connecting their dorsal fin and adipose fin, not present in most other genera.[3] The species of this genus are mainly herbivores and detritivores, but may take other foods in an aquarium setting. Most have probably not been bred in captivity. It is difficult to sex these fish, including adult specimens. These fish are mainly nocturnal, but will also emerge from their hiding places during the day, after some time getting accustomed to the aquarium. Adequate hiding places are recommended for these fish due to their primary nocturnal nature. There are currently eight recognized species in this genus:[2][4] Though there are many types of fish described as Baryancistrus, there are many that yet to be given a true scientific designation, and are only referred to under the L-number system, including the Gold Nuggets. Here is a list of Baryancistrus by L-number designation. The common name and scientific name are included when available, though some of these fish are only commonly referred to by their L-number. For those fish without a scientific name, they are assumed to be Baryancistrus sp. * Note: L200 is also used to refer to Hemiancistrus subviridis, another Loricariid that is very similar in appearance to B. demantoides.

        "description": " Rineloricaria (from the Greek, rhinos meaning nose, and the Latin, lorica meaning cuirass of leather) is a genus of freshwater tropical catfish (order Siluriformes) belonging to the family Loricariidae. They are commonly called whiptail catfish because of the long filament that grows out of the tip of the caudal fin that is characteristic of the genus. With the exception of R. altipinnis from Panama, they are native to the rivers of northern and central South America. Some species are regularly seen in the aquarium trade. This genus was described by Pieter Bleeker in 1862, with R. lima as the type species.[1] This genus is by far one of the most speciose of the subfamily Loricariinae, containing about 30 species.[2] On the other hand, it is one of the least resolved genera.[3] In 2008, 14 new species were added to this genus.[2][4][5][6][7] Hemiloricaria, Fonchiiichthys, and Leliella been variably considered synonyms of Rineloricaria; these genera were erected to account for differences in sexually dimorphic traits. However, the traits used to diagnose these genera have been thought to be insufficient.[2] There are currently 67 recognized species in this genus:[8] The genus is widely distributed on nearly the entire subcontinent, from Costa Rica to Argentina, on both slopes of the Andes.[11] Rineloricaria species are found in a large variety of habitats, including large rivers, streams, and lagoons, associated with bottoms consisting of sand or rocks, sometimes found in marginal vegetation. They are also found to tolerate environments with a wide temperature gradient.[6] Rineloricaria have an adaptive capacity enabling many species to exploit the most varied habitats; some species, such as R. strigilata, have been caught in highly polluted bodies of water and represent some of the main components of the ichthyological diversity in such habitats.[3] The average length of a Rineloricaria catfish is about 13\u00a0cm (5\u00a0in) long.[citation needed] The fish are long, slender, have no visible barbels, an erect dorsal fin, a very thin caudal peduncle, and a narrow face. The coloration of the fishes is usually light brown with darker blotches, and have a dark dorsal fin.[citation needed] They are also covered with bony plates and have a sucker disk mouth, as is common with most fish in the family Loricariidae. Sexual dimorphism includes hypertrophied development of the odontodes along the sides of the head, on the pectoral spines and rays, and predorsal area of mature males. Several species also show hypertrophied development of the odontodes on the entire caudal peduncle.[11] In males, the pectoral fin spine is often thick, short, and curved when compared to the female.[2] Rineloricaria are cavity brooders. Numerous eggs (often more than 100) are laid attached to one another in single layer masses on the cavity floor, and are brooded by males.[11] Rineloricaria exhibit high levels of karyotypic diversity with chromosome numbers ranging from 36 to 70.[11]"

This genus has a unique body shape that resembles a thin stick of wood. The body is slender and elongate, often with a pronounced rostrum and a brownish color with two lateral dark stripes beginning at the tip of the rostrum, passing over the eyes and ending at the tail, which are periodically interrupted on the caudal peduncle.[1] The genus is placed within the tribe Harttiini of the subfamily Loricariinae. Morphological, molecular and phylogenetic studies have placed Farlowella as sister to Sturisoma.[1] The genus name of Farlowella is named in honor of William Gilson Farlow, a famous American botanist of Harvard University whose main work was working with algae plants, the favorite food of this slender catfish.[2] There are currently 30 recognized species in this genus:[2]"

        "description": " The genus Panaque contains a small number of small to medium-sized South American suckermouth armoured catfishes that are notable for being among the very few vertebrates that feed extensively on wood.[1]  In addition, algae and aufwuchs are an important part of the diet, and they use their rasping teeth to scrape this from rocks. These fish are also popular aquarium fish, where the sound of scraping as these fish forage for food is easily audible.[citation needed] Scobinancistrus and Panaqolus are sometimes considered to be subgenera of this genus.[2] There are currently seven recognized species in this genus:[3] The name Panaque is a Latinisation of a native Venezuelan name for these fish. It is pronounced \"pan ack\" in Britain and Europe, but often as \"pan aki\" or \"pan a kay\" in America. The Japanese call these fish \"pana koo ee\".[citation needed] Panaque are found in the Magdalena River, Orinoco River, Amazon River, Essequibo River, and Lake Maracaibo drainages.[5] All Panaque come from tropical South American and inhabit fast-flowing streams and rivers. They are weak swimmers but like other armoured catfish possess a strong sucker-like mouth with which they can hold on to submerged rocks and wood.[citation needed] Like other members of the armoured catfish family (Loricariidae), all Panaque have sturdy, armoured bodies covered in toughened plates of skin called scutes. These are not scales; like all catfish, Panaque lack scales. As well their armour, these catfish have very sturdy dorsal and pectoral fin spines. They use these defensively, either to wedge themselves into cracks from which predators cannot pull them, or else to prevent large predators from swallowing them. Another characteristic typical of the armoured catfish family is an iris. Most fish are unable to regulate the amount of light that enters the eye since they have irises that cannot change size. Both male and female Panaque develop bristles, known as odontodes, on the side of head immediately before and onto the pectoral fins.[citation needed] Unlike predatory catfish, these omnivorous catfish have very short barbels. These barbels can be seen in the photograph of mouth of a Panaque shown here; they are the short pointed structures on either side of a suckermouth. This sucker-like mouth allows them to attach to rocks and remain stationary with very little expenditure of energy.[citation needed] Along with the species of the Hypostomus cochliodon group (formerly the genus Cochliodon), it has been argued that Panaque are the only fish that can eat and digest wood.[5] Possible adaptations to consuming wood include spoon-shaped, scraper-like teeth and highly angled jaws to chisel wood.[5] Researchers have also identified symbiotic gut bacteria that may allow the fish to digest the wood they consume.[6] However, others have argued that Panaque do not in fact digest wood, and in fact take up very little energy from the wood they consume and actually lose weight when fed just wood.[7] Furthermore, their digestive tracts are no different from those of related catfish and they do not hold wood particles in the gut longer than other catfish, suggesting Panaque are not physically adapted to eating wood, and are in fact detritivores much like other Loricariidae.[7] In September 2010 scientists from the US National Science Foundation claimed to have discovered a new species of wood-eating catfish in the Alto Pur\u00fas National Park, Peru.[8] Several species of Panaque have become popular aquarium fish. The brightly coloured Panaque nigrolineatus is particularly popular and is known as the \"royal panaque\" or \"royal pleco\", monikers which reflect its comparative costliness and beauty over the common pleco. Royal plecos have a greyish-green base color against which thick, dark bluish-black stripes are set; their fins are edged with gold or cream, and their eyes are red. In captivity, royal plecos typically grow to around 30\u00a0centimeters in length.[9] A second species, Panaque cochliodon, is familiar to many aquarists as the \"blue-eyed pleco\". Though the blue-eyed pleco was widely traded in the late 1980s and early 1990s, it is now only rarely exported from its native Colombia.[10] It is also associated with the binomina Panaque suttonorum and P. suttoni, though Panaque suttonorum is a different fish which only comes from Venezuela. Blue-eyed plecos reach a similar size to royal plecos, but because many specimens are infected with a bacterium closely related to Rickettsia, mortality immediately after import can be high.[11] However, once they have settled in and begun feeding, they are no more difficult to keep than royal plecos.[citation needed] All Panaque catfish require much the same care in captivity. Panaque mainly demand a mixed diet including green algae, fresh vegetables such as carrots, courgettes, and spinach, but because they are argued to be xylophagous, many aquarists provide driftwood for them to graze upon, as well. The meaty foods enjoyed by other plecos are not required. Because they are relatively big for aquarium fish and produce an unusually large amount of waste, a high-capacity tank and filter are essential. Royal panaques tolerate a wider range of water chemistry than others\u2014they prefer somewhat soft, slightly acid water but they will tolerate hard, alkaline water.[citation needed] In terms of behavior, Panaque are peaceful and nocturnal bottom-dwellers which make good residents in community tanks. Like most of the other armored catfish, they are territorial, and groups should only be kept in very large tanks.[citation needed]"

        "description": " Pseudorinelepis genibarbis is a species of armored catfish native to Brazil, Peru, and Ecuador where it is found in the Amazon basin.[1] Pseudorinelepis is one of three genera contained in the tribe Rhinelepini, one of the tribes of Hypostominae.[2] Canthopomus and Monistiancistrus are synonyms of the genus Pseudorinelepis.[3] Previously, Pseudorinelepis was a genus of four species, but now the other three species are synonymous with P. genibarbis.[3] P. genibarbis is large and bulky and reaches a length of 35.6 centimetres (14.0\u00a0in) SL.[1] The armor plates along the side of the fish are thick, are keeled, and encase the whole body.[3] The adipose fin is not present.[3] Like other members of Rhinelepini, they do not have the omega iris that is typical in most species of Loricariids.[3] In Iquitos, Peru, it is known as carachama sin costilla, which actually means \"Loricariid without ribs\"; this refers to the trait that it shares with other Rhinelepini catfish that do not have ribs past the sixth vertebra.[3] This species is highly variable in coloration. P. genibarbis may be completely dark brown to black, mottled with tan to dark brown background and black streaks, or light tan with large, sparse spots located at base of lateral plates, fin membranes, and abdomen.[3] Males have longer odontodes on the cheek that are denser and more numerous than in females. It has been suggested that breeding males may also have orange on the cheeks and dorsal and caudal fin spines, although this may be restricted to fish from the Branco River.[3] P. genibarbis is found in small, sluggish streams, floodplain lakes, and large rivers.[3] Water quality measurements showed that the water tended to be low in oxygen, but neutral (pH\u00a07.0).[1] P. genibarbis is able to swallow air, like many other Loricariids. However, this species is not an obligate air-breather.[1] When disturbed, it is able to swallow air to become neutrally buoyant and swim in the water column.[1] This species is an armored catfish which, since the 1990s, has started to be offered quite regularly as an aquarium fish under the name \"Pineapple Pleco\".[citation needed] The term \"pleco\" here is of course a popular generalisation, as taxonomy has never placed this fish in the former genus Plecostomus. The armour is also pleasantly spiked along the sides of the fish, which causes the pineapple resemblance celebrated in the commercial name of the species. Additionally, under the L-number system used by hobbyists, it as referred to as both L152 and L095. There is quite a degree of colour variation, which is probably the main reason for the confusion over species. Some males having orange cheeks, which is why \"orange cheek Pleco\" is another common name found in circulation.[4] This is not made any easier by the fact that the fish will gradually darken if left in a tank with a darker substrate and lighten when kept on a lighter substrate. These changes take some time (hours or days) to effect, they do not happen quickly, so there is no real \"chameleon\" effect here, but no doubt it is a useful survival mechanism.[citation needed] From the viewpoint of the aquarist the fish is peaceful, sociable with others of its own type, non-territorial and omnivorous. Unsurprisingly, therefore, they do well in soft water, although pH values of up to 7.5 are acceptable, and the temperature range may fluctuate gently between 23-27\u00a0\u00b0C (73.4-80.6\u00a0\u00b0F.[4] Spawning in captivity has not yet been reliably reported.[4] Sexual dimorphism is slight, being determined mainly by a more rounded body shape in the females, and orange \"cheeks\", this refers to the operculum, in the males. The fish will, unlike most hypostomines, feed on flake from the water surface, turning upside-down to do so.[citation needed] It is also able to augment water-dissolved oxygen with atmospheric oxygen, but does not need to do so, having fully functional gills, so when this fish does gulp it is a useful warning that the aeration in the tank is low.[1]"

This species will grow to a maximum length of 43 centimetres (17\u00a0in) SL and reach a weight of 310 g.[1] It is sometimes confused with the Hypostomus plecostomus (another armored catfish known as the \"common plecostomus\").[2] The two species can be distinguished by their number of dorsal rays. P. pardalis has 11\u201313, while the H. plecostomus has only 5\u20138 dorsal rays. It is also commonly misindentified as P. disjunctivus and can be differentiated by its spotted patterning.[3] There is an albino color variation of this species, usually referred to as an \"Albino Plecostomus\".[4] The amelanistic form may also be sold as the \"chocolate pleco\".[5] The species is native to the Amazon River Basin of Brazil and Peru, preferring pH ranges of 7.0\u20137.5. It is a facultative air breather; although normally a bottom-dwelling fish, it has the ability to breathe air from the surface of the water during dry periods or when dissolved oxygen is too low. The Amazon sailfin catfish has been introduced to a number of countries outside its native range.[1] It is recorded in the Marikina River in the Philippines and known as the \"janitor fish\", where it has become a local pest and sold in bulk, in efforts to eliminate the fish.[6][7][8][9] In the United States, invasive populations of sailfin catfishes like the Amazon sailfin catfish have been observed to be ecologically detrimental, as they disrupt aquatic food chains, decrease the abundance of native aquatic species, and degrade aquatic plants or banks of waterbodies through burrowing and tunneling.[10]"

It is one of a number of species commonly referred to as \"plecostomus\" or \"common pleco\" by aquarists. H. punctatus is a species of loricariid catfish. Like other members of this family, it possesses a suckermouth, armor plates, strong dorsal and pectoral fin spines, and the omega iris. This species reaches about 30 centimetres (12\u00a0in) TL.[1] Hypostomus punctatus is difficult to distinguish from closely related species, such as Hypostomus plecostomus. Identification is relatively difficult as there are many different similar species labelled as \"common pleco\". This species has a light brown coloration with a pattern of darker brown spots (its specific epithet, punctatus, means \"spotted\"). Because of this, the species may also be known as the spotted hypostomus. The species is not notably striped and is generally lighter in coloration than H. plecostomus.[2] H. punctatus is found in the wild in fast-flowing rivers as well as in flooded areas. It prefers water with a temperature of 22\u201328\u00a0\u00b0C, a pH range of 5\u20138, and a dH range of 0.5\u201325.[1] H. punctatus is primarily herbivorous and feeds on algae and detritus as well as plants and roots.[1]"

Although the name Hypostomus plecostomus is often used to refer to common plecostomus sold in aquarium shops, most are actually members of other genera.[3][1] Suckermouth catfish are of little or no value as a food fish, although they are at least occasionally consumed over their native range.[citation needed] A demand exists for them, however, as a bottom cleaner in the aquarium trade.[4] This species' native range is tropical northeastern South America; it naturally occurs in northeastern Brazil, the Guianas, and Trinidad and Tobago.[5] Confusingly, the name Hypostomus plecostomus (or Plecostomus plecostomus) has sometimes been incorrectly used for several more-or-less similar loricariid catfishes, both in the popular and scientific literature. For example, it has sometimes been suggested that it occurs in southern Central America, but this is an entirely separate species, Hemiancistrus aspidolepis (also known under another synonym, Hypostomus panamensis).[6][7] Some Loricariidae species have been widely introduced to several countries around the world and reported as H. plecostomus.[5] It is erroneous,[1] and the concerned species belong to the genus Pterygoplichthys (either P. pardalis,[8] P. disjunctivus,[9] P. anisitsi[10] or P. multiradiatus[11]). In the United States, a Pterygoplichthys species has been introduced to some regions in the South, most likely released by aquarists into the local waters. For example, they are present in a lake in the neighborhood of Hammock Trace Preserve in Melbourne, Florida. In Texas, reproducing populations occur in spring-influenced habitats of the San Antonio River (Bexar County), Comal Springs (Comal County), San Marcos River (Hays County), and San Felipe Creek (Val Verde County), as well as in drainage canals in the Rio Grande Valley and Houston.[12][13] The same identification issues have spread in the literature regarding the invasive catfishes in Taiwan, with H. plecostomus being one of the numerous names used to designate the species: DNA studies showed the alien fishes were actually P. pardalis and P. disjunctivus (that hybridise extensively).[14] H. plecostomus prefer to live in water between 72 and 86 degrees Fahrenheit (~22.2 to 30 degrees Celsius), with a pH between 6.5 and 7.5.[15] Hypostomus plecostomus is named for its sucker-like mouth, which allows it to adhere to a surface, as well as to hold and rasp at food, including newly hatched and baby golden apple snails as well as Malaysian trumpet snails.[16] This omnivorous species also feeds on algae, aquatic plants, and small crustaceans.[17][citation needed] Hypostomus plecostomus is one of many species of fish that is able to breathe air. Hypostomus plecostomus relies on its gills for respiration in normal and slightly hypoxic water, and the less oxygen present in the water, the more frequently it surfaces to breathe air.[18] The air is taken to the stomach where the oxygen is absorbed, and the air can be kept in the stomach to increase buoyancy, which may help it to feed on vegetation.[19] H. plecostomus is one of a number of species commonly referred to as \"plecostomus\" or \"common pleco\" by aquarists.  These fish are sold when they are young and small, but in the wild, they can grow to be a maximum size of 50 centimetres (20\u00a0in).[20] In captivity, however, a full-grown Hypostomus plecostomus only reaches 15 inches (38\u00a0cm) on average, which could be explained by the subpar oxygen levels in most home aquaria and other practices of bad fish husbandry.[21] In the aquarium trade, this dark-colored, bottom-feeding, nocturnal catfish is often purchased for its ability to clean algae from fish tanks but also contributes a lot of waste to the nitrogen cycle. They are difficult for other fish to harass, both due to the semi-aggressive nature of the fish as well as its thick armor.[22] In Bangladesh, the species, among some other suckermouth catfishes has become invasive. The government is currently on its way to impose a ban on the farming, hatchling production, breeding, marketing and trading of the fish.[23] It has also raised serious concern in India and Sri Lanka.[24] A large variety of common names is used to describe H. plecostomus, where plecostomus and the shortened \"pleco\" are interchangeable in all common names. The names include: The species' scientific name, Hypostomus plecostomus, is derived from the Latin hypo (meaning \"under\"), stoma (meaning \"mouth\"), and pleco (meaning \"pleated\").[citation needed] Many of the common names used to identify Hypostomus plecostomus are also used for other species, which augments the confusion surrounding H. plecostomus and other Loricariidae such as H. punctatus, Pterygoplichthys multiradiatus and P. pardalis. In 2012, Weber, Covain, and Fisch-Muller showed the type series of Carl Linnaeus was heterogenous and comprised two species: H. plecostomus (for which the authors designate a lectotype) and H. watwata.[1]"

        "description": " Pterygoplichthys gibbiceps[1]  is a species of armored catfish native to Brazil, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela where it is found in the Orinoco and Amazon basins. Pterygoplichthys gibbiceps shows all the characteristic features of its genus\u2014a large dorsal fin with more than nine rays, prominent nasal flares and a prominent hump or crest anterior to the dorsal fin as well as a substantial base to the dorsal fin. Adult fish easily attain a length of 50.0 centimetres (19.7\u00a0in) TL and can live for more than 20 years. A typical plec shape is shown, patternation consists of primarily irregular largish brown spots on a yellowish backgroung giving a honeycombed like appearance, additional pattern features common to related species may be visible on close inspection. As this fish grows the spots get smaller. Like most plecs this species is primarily herbivorous though will eat dead animals. In the wild these fish are found in shoals in sluggish rivers of the Amazon and Orinoco river systems, they also occupy flooded land during the wet season. During the dry season P. gibbiceps will aestivate in burrows around 1 metre long dug into mud banks along the length of a river, egg rearing is also presumed to take place in burrow. The species name comes from the Latin gibbus\u2014hump, and caput\u2014head, a reference to the centrally located ridge. Common names include 'gibbys', leopard sailfin catfish and clown plecs\u2014the juveniles have a comical appearance due to the large and obvious spots. Ancistrus gibbiceps and Glyptoperichthys gibbiceps are synonyms of P. gibbiceps.\nThe fish has recently been caught from river Ganges, Banaras and is suspected to be yet another entrant to Invasive exotic list of fish in India. This fish is extremely popular in the aquarium, due to its unusual appearance and its ability to eat algae; the bane of all aquarists. This and other related species are bred in ponds in tropical regions for the aquarium trade. In general P. gibbiceps is peaceful towards other fish though territorial disputes arise with other plecos and fish of a similar or larger size. Though not nocturnal they are more active at night and will spend daylight hours 'hiding' in a secluded location. As the fish grows big (up to 60.96\u00a0cm in the aquarium) a large tank with good filtration is required, in general these fish are tolerant to a wide range of freshwater conditions though prefer well aerated water. The fish will 'gulp' surface air in poorly oxygenated water. A lesser-known trait is its mild camouflage ability, where it can lighten or darken its scales in a tiger-stripe pattern. It may reflect its mood or comfortability with the water parameters.[2][3] Pterygoplichthys gibbiceps is an omnivore. They can be fed with vegetables such as nettles, lettuce, spinach or carrots. Their diet can include meat; such as earthworms, blood worms or chopped shrimps.  They will also eat prepared foods from a pet shop, especially sinking algae wafers. The best way to breed Pterygoplichthys gibbiceps is to feed them with wide spectrum of food. With a good diet, they will grow quickly (up to 30 centimetres in one year). Adult Pterygoplichthys gibbiceps  may eat many aquarium plants. It can be almost impossible to differentiate males from females. Males in a group can be determined as they may become more territorial. Reproduction involves females laying roes into caves or hollows of roots. There is a high rate of mortality until the spawn are five centimeters long. The reason for this is unknown."

        "description": " The zebra pleco (Hypancistrus zebra) is a species of catfish endemic to a small section of the Rio Xingu in Brazil. It occurs in the big bend area of the river, downstream from the town of Altamira, Para. It was first described in 1991.[3] It gets its name from its black and white stripes, resembling the colouration of a zebra. This species grows to a length of 6.4 centimetres (2.5\u00a0in) SL.[3] This species was exported from Brazil in 1987 for sale as aquarium fish. However, currently, the Brazilian government bans the export of certain fish species, including H. zebra. H. zebra is threatened by the Belo Monte Dam in the Xingu river which has caused a severe reduction of the water flow of the entire known distribution range of the species. Due to this, the species has been classified as critically endangered and may soon become extinct in the wild. It is subject to several captive breeding programs. It is commercially bred in captivity for the aquarium trade. Mature males have a wider head and longer interopercular spines than females. After spawning, the males will guard the eggs. The fry swim after seven days and absorb the yolk sac in two weeks.[4] The minimum tank size for the species is said to be a minimum of 30 gallons (approximately 115 liters).\u00a0Maintaining water parameters at certain levels is also of importance when keeping them in an aquarium. The ideal water temperature for their tank is about 79\u201388\u00a0\u00b0F (26\u201331\u00a0\u00b0C). Reasonable water acidity levels are 6.5 pH to 7.0 pH with the water hardness ranging between 2 and 6 dKH.[5] Hypancistrus zebra can be referred to using the L-numbering convention often applied to Loricariidae, although, unlike most loricariids, H. zebra has two associated L-numbers: L-046 and L-098 both refer to the species. H. zebra is a predator and requires a high protein diet, typically including small invertebrates such as insect larvae. When in captivity, the species is often fed fresh or frozen bloodworms, brine shrimp and algae wafers. Occasionally, the species may be fed vegetables such as lettuce, cucumber, and squash.[5] This species should not be kept in the typical community aquarium, or with discus, despite advice to the contrary. These catfish thrive in biotopes with small dither fish which do not compete with H. zebra for food. The tank should mimic their natural environment with a substrate of small smooth gravel and pebbles with smooth boulders, cobbles and rocks forming caves and crevices.[6] The water must be highly oxygenated with a strong flow and surface agitation. It is an expensive species because it can only be collected or reproduced in small numbers. It is a simple fish to keep but it needs clean, warm water and a fast-moving current. They are unlikely to survive in still water or a dirty environment.[4] It is nocturnal, moderately territorial, and prefers plenty of hiding places.[4] In 2004, the zebra pleco was added to the IBAMA list of endangered species and exporting it from Brazil was made illegal. However, this law is only present in Brazil and black market fish traders smuggle them out of Brazil to then sell in other countries (primarily Colombia). Similarly to other Hypancistrus species, the male will trap the female in a cave where she will lay her eggs for the male to fertilise. This is usually done at around a pH of 6.5-7.2 and a water temp of 27\u00b0. This process can take between 1 and 5 days depending on the experience the female has in motherhood. The male will often bite the female to keep her in the cave, which is a natural behaviour for the species. Once the eggs are fertilised, the female will leave, although the male will guard the eggs until they hatch and may even stay to see them develop into fry. Once born, the fry will have a yolk sack attached to their underbelly, which is typically gone in a few days.[7] The species is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that international trade (including in captive bred specimens) is regulated by the CITES permitting system.[2]"

        "description": " Pterygoplichthys multiradiatus is one of several tropical fish commonly known as Orinoco sailfin catfish, plecostomus (or plecos). It belongs to the armored catfish family (Loricariidae). Named for its sail-like dorsal fin, the part of its scientific name multiradiatus means \"many-rayed\" and refers to the rays of the dorsal fin. P. multiradiatus is one of a number of species commonly referred to as the common pleco by aquarists.[1] Other scientific names that were used (as synonyms) for P. multiradiatus include Hypostomus multiradiatus, Ancistrus multiradiatus, and Liposarcus multiradiatus. P. multiradiatus is sometimes confused with Pterygoplichthys pardalis, which is a different species of pleco. P. multiradiatus goes by a number of common names. It can be called the \"long-fin armored catfish\" in Hawaii, \"sailfin catfish\", \"sailfish catfish\", \"many-rayed (multiradiatus) pleco\" or \"radiated ptero\" in the United States, \u591a\u8f3b\u7ffc\u7532\u9bf0 in Mandarin Chinese.\nP. multiradiatus is mottled brown/black and inhabits freshwater streams and lakes and in weedy, mud-bottomed canals in its native habitat: the Orinoco River basin in Venezuela. Its geographic distribution is 10\u00b0N - 1\u00b0N, 68\u00b0W - 61\u00b0W. This tropical, nocturnal bottom-dweller likes warm water at the temperature range of 23\u201327\u00a0\u00b0C, pH range: 6.5\u20137.8, and dH range: 4\u201320. P. multiradiatus browses on substrate, mainly feeding on benthic algae and aquatic weeds, but will also take worms, insect larvae and other bottom-dwelling invertebrates as food. One of the large plecos (growing to a maximum of 50.0 centimetres (19.7\u00a0in) TL), this species likes solitude, is relatively peaceful as an aquarium fish and does well with cichlids and other big fish, and should be kept in large tanks only and with plenty of rocks and driftwood in which to hide. Like many other plecos, it is very important in the aquarium trade. P. multiradiatus has been introduced to Taiwan,[2] Puerto Rico,[3] Florida, Hawaii, Texas, India, and Mexico,[4] most likely as the result of escapes or releases from aquarium fish farms. This species is firmly established in these and other locations, where it is regarded as a harmful invasive species being relatively inedible to people and predators, causing damage to fishing gear, competing and harming against native species and disrupting environments by its burrowing activities.[4] In this context its relative, Hypostomus plecostomus, has also been similarly implicated though it seems likely that in Asia, both or related species are implicated."

These fish are found in mid-sized creeks with clear water. It may also be found in small ponds.[1] They associate with marginal vegetation.[2] The zebra oto has a general body-shape like other Otocinclus species. They are small, have a suckermouth, and have armor on their bodies. The zebra oto can be distinguished from all other members of this genus by its vertical stripe-like blotches and its complete lateral line. The zebra oto has the highest number of teeth of any species of Otocinclus. The W mark on its caudal fin distinguishes this fish from all others except for O. batmani. The zebra oto reaches about 4.4\u00a0cm (1.7\u00a0in) in SL, though the males are smaller.[2] The zebra oto is listed as endangered by the IUCN Red List due to its limited range and overexploitation for the aquarium trade. Additionally, it is not protected in any part of its range, nor is it listed on CITES. The species has a decreasing population trend in the wild.[1] The zebra oto has been for sale in the aquarium trade since the early 1990s. It has been popular since at least 2000.[2] They are an occasionally seen species, and are bred in Asia in good numbers.[4]"

It reaches a length of 8.8 centimetres (3.5\u00a0in) SL.[2] This species has a striped pattern. However, this colouration may change with age. There are specimens with straight bars, but there are also specimens with a broken or wavy pattern. The wavy pattern form is found in the actual Orinoco and its tributaries in Bolivar State, Venezuela, while the \"normal\" patterned P. maccus comes from further north and west (Cojedes, Portuguesa, Guarico, and Apure States) in the Llanos where the drainages run into the Apure River.[1] Panaqolus maccus is one of the most common species of small, striped loricariids available in the fishkeeping hobby. This species adapts well to aquarium life.[1] They are not too difficult to spawn.[1] It should always be provided with enough driftwood in the tank, as it is a wood-eating fish. However fresh vegetables, spirulina and frozen foods such as bloodworms are recommended to be given as well from time to time. They are very peaceful fish suited for the average community tank. They are a hardy species of catfish and can tolerate various water parameters but prefer softer, more acidic water. Good filtration is needed because of the large amounts of waste they produce, caused by their wood-based diet. It is suited for tanks starting from 15 gallons.[1] It is difficult to successfully breed these fish in captivity. The tank setting and water parameters must be as near to their native habitat as possible. Seasonal changes can be simulated by adjusting the pH and temperature of the water. Soft driftwoods and cave formations give ample hiding places for the females to feel comfortable, and they may deposit eggs at some point.[3]"

        "description": " The redtail catfish, Phractocephalus hemioliopterus, is a pimelodid (long-whiskered) catfish. In Venezuela, it is known as cajaro, in Guyana, it is known as a banana catfish, and in Brazil, it is known as pirarara,[2] stemming from the Tupi language words pir\u00e1 and arara.[3] It is the only extant species of the genus Phractocephalus. This fish is common in the aquarium trade, although its massive adult size makes it unsuitable for all but the largest aquariums.[4] They feed on fish, crustaceans and fallen fruits.[5] They are not evaluated by IUCN. Although the redtail catfish is the only living representative of this genus, there are other members that date back to the upper Miocene, and are only known from fossil remains. P.\u00a0nassi was described in 2003, from the Urumaco Formation at Urumaco, Venezuela. Another fossil species, P.\u00a0acreornatus, is known from the Solim\u00f5es Formation, Acre, Brazil.[1][2] This genus has a minimum age of about 13.5\u00a0million years.[2] Phractocephalus hemioliopterus can reach about 1.8\u00a0m (5\u00a0ft 11\u00a0in) in length, and about 80\u00a0kg (180\u00a0lb) in weight.[6] However, this is exceptionally rare, and most do not approach this size. They average 3\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in\u00a0\u2013 4\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in; 1.1\u20131.4\u00a0m in length. These colorful large catfishes have a brownish back, with yellow sides, and characteristic orange-red dorsal fin and caudal fin (hence the common name). Sometimes the dorsal, pelvic and anal fins are also red. They have a broad head with long whiskers, dark black body and white underneath that extends from the mouth to the caudal fin. It has a pair of barbels on the upper jaw, and two pairs on the lower jaw. Their whiskers are sensitive and have chemical reception cells which are used as the sense of smell. They breed using external fertilization after laying their eggs. They communicate by making a clicking sound to warn off potential dangers.[5] The redtail catfish is native to the Amazon, Orinoco, and Essequibo river basins of South America, in Ecuador, Venezuela, Guyana, Colombia, Peru, Suriname, Bolivia, and Brazil.[2] It is found only in fresh water, and inhabits larger rivers, streams, and lakes.[7][4] They eat during the evening and night and stay motionless during the day. They are bottom-dwellers and move about quite slowly. Red-tailed catfish are territorial fish.[5] Redtail catfish is also an invasive species in Malaysia; they are now found mostly in the Perak River and Pahang River.[citation needed] Due to the potential large size of this species, redtail catfish are considered a game fish by anglers. The current IGFA world record for weight belongs to the Brazilian Gilberto Fernandes with 56\u00a0kg (123\u00a0lb 7\u00a0oz).[8] It is said that the natives do not eat the meat of the redtail catfish because it is black in coloration.[9] In Thailand, it is an alien species that has been introduced by humans, like the common pleco, zebra tilapia, and alligator gar.[10]\nIn some places, it is feared because it has been believed to be the cause of the mysterious drownings of many of the passengers aboard the passenger ship Sobral Santos II when it sank. The redtail catfish is an extremely popular fish in Amazonian-themed exhibits at public aquaria, where they are often housed with other large fish, such as Colossoma macropomum or pacu, and other large catfish. Juveniles are often available as aquarium fish, despite their eventual large size. In an aquarium where they may be well-fed, these fish can grow quite rapidly,[9] and require tanks of at least 10,000\u00a0L (2,600\u00a0US\u00a0gal) when fully mature.[4] Weekly feeding is appropriate for this catfish; overfeeding is a common cause of death in this species.[11] It feeds heavily on live and dead fishes and other meat. Even as a juvenile of only a few inches in length, they are able to swallow many of the more common aquarium fish (such as tetras or guppies), and it is only appropriate to house this fish with other species of relatively large size. Redtail catfish also have a habit of swallowing inedible objects in the aquarium. Though these are often regurgitated, both the swallowing and the regurgitation can present a problem for the fish, and these objects are best kept out of the aquarium.[11] The redtail catfish has been hybridized with other fish, such as the Pseudoplatystoma or Tiger Shovelnose Catfish, through the use of hormones, in attempts to create a viable food fish: the Tiger Redtail Catfish. These hybrid fish sometimes make it into the aquarium hobby under a variety of common names.[11]"

Pictus catfish are sometimes mislabeled as Angelicus cats in the aquarium trade, but the latter name actually refers to an unrelated  African catfish, the mochokid Synodontis angelica.[1] Pimelodus pictus should not be confused with Leiarius pictus, a much larger (60\u00a0cm) pimelodid. Pimelodus pictus, like other members of the Pimelodidae, are known for having extremely long barbels. These can extend all the way to the caudal fin. The fish are silver-colored with black spots and stripes. They have sharp spines on their dorsal and pectoral fins, which makes shipping a difficult task, since the spines can pierce plastic bags and get caught in nets. There is relatively little sexual dimorphism, with females being slightly larger than males.[2] Like many catfish, P.\u00a0pictus has a downturned mouth and a forked tail.[3] These fish are active swimmers and, like many catfish, nocturnal bottom feeders.[1] Two forms are known; a large-spotted form and a small-spotted form. Of the two, only the large-spotted form is commonly seen in the aquarium trade; it does not grow as large as the small-spotted form.[3] In captivity, these fish prefer soft water and are omnivorous; pictus cats eat bloodworms, beef heart, insects, vegetables, and prepared fish foods. They will also eat very small fish such as neon tetras, depending on the size of the catfish. Despite this, they are generally non-aggressive and will not harm fish too large for them to eat. A larger tank is required as these fish are agile and fast swimmers. They are also non-territorial and can be kept with other P. pictus. Besides the mildly venomous sting imparted by the dorsal spine, they are generally harmless to humans. In the wild, Pimelodus pictus has an estimated average trophic level of 3.19.[4]"

They become sexually mature at 56\u00a0cm (22\u00a0in), males at 45\u00a0cm (18\u00a0in)[3] and this species reaches a maximum length of 90\u00a0cm (35\u00a0in) TL.[1] Fecundity seems to be estimated at 8 million eggs per kg,[4] but was recently measured in aquaculture at a lower, and more likely number of 150,000 eggs laid per kg.[3] According to Riehl and Haensch, five subspecies have been described:[5] However, Buitrago\u2013Su\u00e1rez and Burr place P. f. brevifile, P. f. intermedium, and P. f. nigricans, in the synonymy of P. punctifer. P. f. reticulatum is elevated as another distinct species P. reticulatum.[1] Previously, all subspecies except P. f. reticulatum were considered synonyms of P. fasciatum.[2] The species is of interest for aquaculture for food production (and indirectly as conservation measure because it may lower the fishing pressure on wild population), as well as for production of fish.\nMaturation in earthen tanks of fish caught in the wild is not problematic, since manipulation of fish during fishing and transportation is well done.\nReproduction may be obtained with two injections of Ovaprim\u00ae in 24 hours (10% and 90% of the recommended dosis, respectively), ovulation occurs after around 8 hr at 27\u00a0\u00b0C.[3] Incubation of eggs is carried out in \"Zug\" jars and hatching occurs 24 hours after fertilization at 26,5\u00a0\u00b0C. Vitelus resorption takes 3 days but larvae start feeding 2 days after hatching, and may start active cannibalism at this moment. Feeding may start 48 hours post-hatching with freshly hatched artemia nauplii, seven times a day. Larvae must be kept in the dark in order to maximize uniform distribution of larvae in the tanks and therefore food availability.[6] After 15 days, food may be completed and then replaced gradually with ground mammalian liver. After 20 days post hatching, fingerling may be fed high quality pelleted food adapted to their size.  This Pimelodidae-related article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it."

The sides have a white band, bordered below by a dark gray or brown band. The venter is usually white with some large spots. The dorsal fin and adipose fin are spotted.[7] However, in juveniles, the snout is short and the pectoral fins are large and rounded. The white band does not appear until the fish is about 40\u00a00m (1.6\u00a0in).[clarification needed] The full adult color pattern and fin shapes appear by at least 20\u00a0cm (8\u00a0in).[7] This fish is mainly nocturnal.[5] Firewood catfish are highly predatory and feed on other fish.[6]"

        "description": " Synodontis multipunctatus, also known as the cuckoo catfish, cuckoo squeaker, or multipunk, is a small catfish from Lake Tanganyika, one of the lakes in the Great Rift Valley system in Africa. It is a brood parasite upon mouthbrooding cichlids.  This species grows to a length of 27.5 centimetres (10.8\u00a0in) TL.  This species is a minor component of local commercial fisheries.[2] Synodontis multipunctatus is one of a number of species of upside-down catfish in Lake Tanganyika, which is more famous for its cichlids. It gathers in large schools at depths of about 40 metres (130\u00a0ft) in the lake. S. multipunctatus is notable for its breeding behaviour - it is a brood parasite, similar to the cuckoo from which it takes its common name. Lake Tanganyika is home to a number of mouthbrooding cichlids, which care for their eggs and young by carrying them in their mouth. S. multipunctatus uses these, particularly Ctenochromis horei and Simochromis babaulti, as unwitting caretakers for their children. The smell of spawning cichlids excites S. multipunctatus into spawning, and as the cichlids lay their eggs the catfish will quickly slip in and eat the eggs before they can be collected by the mother. While doing so they also release and fertilise their own eggs. The female cichlid will hastily attempt to scoop up her eggs and, in doing so, will also collect eggs from S. multipunctatus. These eggs will then hatch inside the unwilling adoptive mother's mouth, and proceed to eat the cichlid eggs present before being released by the cichlid. This technique removes the burden of parental care from the S. multipunctatus, and allows them to breed again sooner. Synodontis multipunctatus are a popular addition to cichlid aquariums. They grow to about 15 centimetres (5.9\u00a0in), and can be bred in captivity provided suitable hosts are present. Some aquarists have had success with host cichlids from Lake Malawi and Lake Victoria as well as those from Lake Tanganyika.[3] They can be very aggressive and territorial towards other Synodontis species, they should be kept in groups over 3 to avoid competition between two, and proper cover and cave-like structures should be provided. They seem to be active in the day as much as the night and can prove quite lively. If kept in larger groups territorial issues are less likely.

Common names include clown catfish, clown synodontis,[3] clown syno,[4] clown squeaker,[2] and barredtail squeaker.[5] The Synodontis decorus is native to Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of the Congo can be found anywhere in the Congo basin except the Luapula River system. This is one of the many interesting Synodontis species found in Malebo Pool.[2][4] The unusual trait of this Synodontis is the long extension of the dorsal fin which can reach as far back as its caudal fin and along with its attractive body colouration makes it one of the most popular catfish of the genus, Synodontis.[3] The head and body are compressed. It has three pairs of barbells, maxillary barbells with a small membrane at the base and small slender ramifications larger than on maxillary barbells.It is mostly white with black spots. Its ventral region is white. The dorsal, caudal, anal and ventral fins are white with black transverse bands.[3] This species grows to a length of 31.8 centimetres (12.5\u00a0in) TL.[2] As other fish, Synodontis decorus harbours parasites, including species of the monogenean genus Synodontella.[6]"

        "description": " Synodontis petricola, known as the cuckoo catfish,[2] or the pygmy leopard catfish,[3] is a species of upside-down catfish endemic to Burundi, Zambia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Tanzania where it is only known from Lake Tanganyika.[2][4]  It was first described by Belgian ichthyologist Hubert Matthes in 1959.[4]  The species name \"petricola\" is derived from a combination of the Latin petra, meaning stone or rock, and the Latin cola, meaning inhabitant.  This refers to the rocky environment where this species is found.[3] Like all members of the genus Synodontis, S. petricola has a strong, bony head capsule that extends back as far as the first spine of the dorsal fin.[5] The head is about 3\u204410 of the standard length of the fish.[4] The head contains a distinct narrow, bony external protrusion called a humeral process.[3] The shape and size of the humeral process helps to identify the species. In S. petricola, the humeral process is triangular, rough, and is covered in many small, thin papillae.[4] The bottom edge has a poorly-defined ridge on the bottom edge, and the top edge is convex.[4] The humeral process ends in a sharp point.[4] It is about 1\u20442 of the length of the head.[4] The diameter of the eye is about 1\u20449 of the length of the head.[4] The fish has three pairs of barbels. The maxillary barbels are on located on the upper jaw, and two pairs of mandibular barbels are on the lower jaw. The maxillary barbel has a narrow membrane attached near the base and is straight without any branches.[4] It extends at least as far as the base of the pectoral spine, about 3\u20444 of the length of the head.[4] The outer pair of mandibular barbels extends just past the start of the pectoral girdle, about 1\u20442 of the length of the head,[4] and contains four to seven simple branches, usually without any secondary branches.[4] The inner pair of mandibular barbels is about 1\u20443 to 2\u20443 as long as the outer pair, about 1\u20444 of the length of the head,[4] with four to six branches, with many secondary branches present.[4] The skin of S. petricola has a large number of tiny vertical skin folds. The exact purpose of the skin folds is not known, but is a characteristic of the species of Syndontis that are endemic to Lake Tanganyika.[4] External granular papilla are present on the head, but not the body.[4] The front edges of the dorsal fins and the pectoral fins of Syntontis species are hardened into stiff spines.[3] In S. petricola, the spine of the dorsal fin is long, about 3\u20444 as long as the head,[4] is slightly curved, is smooth on the front and with fine serrations the back, and ends with short, white filament.[4] The remaining portion of the dorsal fin is made up of seven dark branching rays.[4] The spine of the pectoral fin is slightly curved, roughly as long as the dorsal fin spine, with large serrations on the back side.[4] The pectoral spine ends in short, white filament.[4] The rest of the pectoral fins are made up of eight to nine branching rays.[4] The adipose fin is large, does not contain any rays, and has a convex shape.[4] The pelvic fin contains one unbranched and six branched rays.[4] The front edge of the pelvic fin is vertically aligned midway between with the back edge of the dorsal fin and the front edge of the adipose fin.[4] The anal fin contains three to four unbranched and seven to nine branched rays; it is vertically aligned with the center of the adipose fin.[4] The tail, or caudal fin, is forked, with rounded lobes, and contains eight rays on the upper lobe, nine rays on the lower lobe.[4] The mouth of the fish faces downward and has wide lips that contain papilla.[4] All members of Syndontis have a structure called a premaxillary toothpad, which is located on the very front of the upper jaw of the mouth. This structure contains several rows of short, chisel-shaped teeth. In some species, this toothpad is made up of a large patch with several rows in a large cluster. In other species of Syndontis, this toothpad is clearly divided into two separate groups, separated by a thin band of skin that divides the toothpad.[4] This character is used as a method of differentiating between to different but similar species of Syndontis.[4] In S. petricola, the toothpad is interrupted, or clearly divided between the groups of teeth on the toothpad.[4] On the lower jaw, or mandible, the teeth of Syndontis are attached to flexible, stalk-like structures and described as \"s-shaped\" or \"hooked\".[3][5] The number of teeth on the mandible is used to differentiate between species; in S. petricola, there are 31 to 50 teeth on the mandible, arranged in a six short rows.[4] Some of the species of Synodontis have an opening or series of openings called the axillary pore. It is located on the side of the body below the humeral process and before the pectoral fin spine. The exact function of the port is not known to scientists, although its presence has been observed in seven other catfish genera. Fish in the genus Acrochordonichthys have been observed to secrete a mucus with toxic properties from their axillary pore, but there is no scientific consensus as to the exact purpose of the secretion or the pore.[4] S. petricola has a small axillary pore just below the humeral process.[4] The back of the fish is yellowish to copper-brown and is covered with large, irregularly-shaped black spots.[4]  In juveniles, these spots can appear larger and sometimes intersect.[4] The underside of the fish is lighter, with small, irregularly shaped spots.  Most of the species of Synodontis of Lake Tanganyika have a recognizable pattern consisting of dark triangles at the bases of all of the rayed fins, present in S. petricola, and the back edges of the fins are white in color.[4] The caudal fin has a black bar that runs from the base of each lobe to the top of the fin.[4] The barbels are white.[4] The maximum standard length of all known specimens is 11.5 centimetres (4.5\u00a0in) and a total length of 13.5 centimetres (5.3\u00a0in).[2][4] In general in Synodontis species, females tend to be slightly larger than males of the same age.[6] In the wild, the species is endemic to Lake Tanganyika, which has a temperature range of 23 to 26\u00a0\u00b0C (73 to 79\u00a0\u00b0F), and an approximate pH of 8.5 \u2013 9, and dH range of 4-15.[7] It inhabits rocky shorelines in the littoral zone, to a maximum depth of 30 metres (98\u00a0ft).[4] The reproductive habits of most of the species of Synodontis are not known, beyond some instances of obtaining egg counts from gravid females.[4] Spawning likely occurs during the flooding season between July and October, and pairs swim in unison during spawning.[8] Juveniles appear to be carnivorous, feeding on water mites, seed shrimp, and insect larvae. Adults feed on algae scraped from rocks as well as small invertebrates.[4] The growth rate is rapid in the first year, then slows down as the fish age.[6] The pygmy leopard catfish practices brood parasitism. It lives among rock piles frequented by various species of mauna: small African cichlids. Courtship behaviour culminates with the female sucking sperm from the male's cloaca. She brings the sperm through her digestive tract to her cloaca, where her eggs meet the sperm. She then rushes into the nest of a cichlid, devours the eggs, and deposits her own. The cichlids then raise the catfish as their own. Data related to Synodontis petricola at Wikispecies"

        "description": " Synodontis angelicus is a species of upside-down catfish commonly named polkadot squeaker, black clown catfish, whitespotted squeaker, pearl squeaker, or angel squeaker.[1][2]  This species is native to the Congo Basin in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of the Congo.  It was originally described in 1891 by Belgian ichthyologist Louise Schilthuis after its discovery in the Malebo Pool of the Congo River.[3]   The specific name \"angelicus\" means heavenly or divine, since juveniles of this species are remarkable for their bright coloring.[3] Adult specimens between 9 and 18 centimetres (3.5 and 7.1\u00a0in) are grey to dark violet, with reddish-yellow to bark brown-red blotches on the head, sides, adipose fin, and partly running together on the ventral surface.[3]   These blotches are evenly distributed and have sharp, distinct edges.[3]   The blotches may be edged with dark violet.  The fins are dark violet with brownish blotches and streaks.[3]   Juveniles between 4 and 9 centimetres (1.6 and 3.5\u00a0in) are strikingly colored, with white, round blotches on a red-violet background.[3] The first ray of the dorsal fin and the pectoral fins have a hardened first ray which is serrated.[2]   The caudal fin is deeply forked with an extension on the top lobe.[2][3]   It has short, cone-shaped teeth in the upper jaw.[2] In the lower jaw, the teeth are s-shaped and movable.[2] This species grows to a length of 25 centimetres (9.8\u00a0in) SL although specimens up to 55 centimetres (22\u00a0in) TL have been recorded in nature.[1] The species is commercially used as an aquarium species.[4]  The polka-dot African catfish is mostly nocturnal.[3] These catfish will excavate the substrate and may nibble plants. They eat smaller live foods and prepared foods. They prefer a water temperature of 24 to 28\u00a0\u00b0C (75 to 82\u00a0\u00b0F), a pH of 6.0\u20138.0 and a hardness of 5\u201319 dGH.[1] Data related to Synodontis angelicus at Wikispecies"

The type specimen is in the Mus\u00e9um National d' Histoire Naturelle de Paris.[4] Like all members of the genus Synodontis, S. nigrita has a strong, bony head capsule that extends back as far as the first spine of the dorsal fin.[5]  The head contains a distinct narrow, bony, external protrusion called a humeral process.[2] The shape and size of the humeral process helps to identify the species. In S. nigrita, the humeral process is as much longer than it is broad, with a ridge on the bottom edge, and with a pointed back end.[4] The fish has three pairs of barbels. The maxillary barbels are on located on the upper jaw, and two pairs of mandibular barbels are on the lower jaw. The maxillary barbel is long and straight without any branches, with a broad membrane at the base.[4] It extends to a length about 1 to 1+2\u20443 times the length of the head.[4] The outer pair of mandibular barbels is about twice the length of the inner pair, and both pairs have short, simple branches.[4] The front edges of the dorsal fins and the pectoral fins of Syntontis species are hardened into stiff spines.[2]  In S. nigrita, the spine of the dorsal fin is straight or slightly curved, 3\u20444 to 1 times the length of the head, smooth in the front and serrated on the back.[4] The remaining portion of the dorsal fin is made up of seven branching rays.[4] The spine of the pectoral fin about the same size as the dorsal spine, and serrated on both sides.[4] The adipose fin is 2+2\u20443 to 3 times as long as it is deep.[4] The anal fin contains four unbranched and eight to nine branched rays.[4] The tail, or caudal fin, is deeply forked, with the upper lobe slightly longer.[4] All members of Syndontis have a structure called a premaxillary toothpad, which is located on the very front of the upper jaw of the mouth. This structure contains several rows of short, chisel-shaped teeth.  In S. nigrita, the toothpad forms a short and broad band.[4]   On the lower jaw, or mandible, the teeth of Syndontis are attached to flexible, stalk-like structures and described as \"s-shaped\" or \"hooked\".[2][5] The number of teeth on the mandible is used to differentiate between species; in S. nigrita, there are about 30 to 35 teeth on the mandible.[4] The body color is brown or olive to blackish, with round black spots likely.  The fins are greyish to blackish; the caudal fin has black spots or black cross bars.  Juveniles are brown, with black spots.[4] The maximum total length of the species is 33.5 centimetres (13.2\u00a0in).[3]  Generally, females in the genus Synodontis tend to be slightly larger than males of the same age.[6] In the wild, the species has been found throughout northern Africa.  In central Africa, it has been recorded in the Ubangui River basin and the central Congo River basin.  In eastern Africa, it is found in Lake Albert and possibly Lake Kyoga.  In northern Africa, it is possibly present in Egypt.  In northeast Africa, it occurs in the White Nile from Khartoum into the Jebel and Ghazal River systems, as well as the Baro River.  In western Africa, the species is known from the Chad River basin, the Niger River basin, the Volta River, the Senegal River, the Gambia River, the Geba River, the Oueme River, and the Casamance River.[1]  The reproductive habits of most of the species of Synodontis are not known, beyond some instances of obtaining egg counts from gravid females.[7] Spawning likely occurs during the flooding season between July and October, and pairs swim in unison during spawning.[8]   As a whole, species of Synodontis are omnivores, consuming insect larvae, algae, gastropods, bivalves, sponges, crustaceans, and the eggs of other fishes.[7]  The growth rate is rapid in the first year, then slows down as the fish age.[6] Data related to Synodontis nigrita at Wikispecies"

These fish are adapted to spend most of their time upside-down. This is reflected in the fish's pigmentation \u2013 their bellies are darker than their backs, a form of countershading.[3] These fish have lighter colors on the top of their bodies and darker colors below used for camouflage. The lighter colors on the top of them make it harder for predators to see the fish when looking up toward the sky but only when the fish are swimming upside-down.[4] Synodontis nigriventris are mostly nocturnal, and feed on insects, crustaceans, and plant matter.[2] These fish lay eggs.[2] The young fish do not swim upside-down until they are about two months old.[5] Adults swim and rest upside down in the water. They swim faster when upside down, and are more likely to be upside down around objects or at the water bottom. The more objects around the fish, the more they tend to swim upside down.[4] When close to an object, the fish puts its ventral side closest to the object.[4] It rarely swims in the middle of the water, preferring to swim either at the bottom or at the surface.[6] By swimming upside down when it feeds,[7] it can readily catch prey at the surface from beneath.[4] The blotched upside-down catfish is well suited to aquariums because of its small size (typically 9 or 10\u00a0cm or less) and peaceful demeanor.[3] Data related to Synodontis nigriventris at Wikispecies"

        "description": " The emerald catfish  (Corydoras splendens) is a tropical freshwater fish belonging to the Corydoradinae sub-family of the family Callichthyidae native to the Amazon Basin in South America.[1] It has traditionally been known as Brochis splendens.[2] The fish has appeared on a stamp in Brazil.[3] It was originally described as Callichthys splendens by Fran\u00e7ois Louis de la Porte, comte de Castelnau in 1855.  This species was once also commonly called Brochis coeruleus. W. A. Gosline was the first to suspect that the two species were the same in 1940, but it was actually Njiseen & Isbr\u00fccker, in 1970, who combined the two, giving sufficient reasons for doing so. The species would be described as Brochis splendens, until most of the catfish formerly classified as Brochis were re-classified into Corydoras.[2] The current recognized classification is thus Corydoras splendens.[1] It is native to the upper reaches Amazon Basin.[1] This includes Ucayali River to Pucallpa, Ambiyacu River, and the area around Iquitos in western Brazil, southeastern Colombia, eastern Ecuador and eastern Peru. Depending upon the angle of lighting, the fish's body reflects a metallic green, blue-green, or even a bluish color.  The ventral area is yellowish with the pectoral, ventral, and anal fins yellowish and the dorsal, caudal, and adipose fins a translucent brownish.  The females are larger and more robust than the males, and have a more pinkish belly as opposed to the more yellowish one for the males. This fish can be distinguished from the green/bronze corydoras catfish by its usually larger size, stouter body, and more pointed snout. The fish inhabits sluggish waters with dense vegetation along the banks.[1] It occurs in shallow muddy waters and will grow in length up to 7.5\u00a0centimetres (3\u00a0in).[1] It lives in a tropical climate in water with a 5.8\u20138.0 pH, a water hardness of 2\u201330 dGH, and a temperature range of 22\u201328\u00a0\u00b0C (72\u201382\u00a0\u00b0F).[1] It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, and insect larvae. It lays eggs in dense vegetation and adults do not guard the eggs. The emerald catfish is a common species in freshwater aquaria.  It is a peaceful, undemanding species and can be maintained under the same conditions as most Corydoras species.  They are shy and easily frightened when kept as individuals, so it is best kept in small groups of at least three, with more being recommended.  The tank should have only a soft, fine bottom to prevent damage to barbels and should be heavily planted.[4] Feeding is not difficult and they accept almost anything, although live worms are especially appreciated.[5] It does well in a community tank and does not tear up the plants.[5] Spawning has been achieved in captivity.[4] Typically, the fish are separated into a breeding tank in the ratio of three males to two females, all well-conditioned on live foods.  The couple will spawn while sitting on the bottom, not while swimming as many similar species do. In captivity, the female collects the eggs in her pelvic fin basket and pastes them individually to plants and other objects.  Eggs will be deposited by the female throughout the tank, but especially on any floating surface plants.  According to most reports, the parents do not immediately try to eat the eggs.  The eggs hatch in about four days and the fry become free swimming two days later."

It is native to South America, and is found in the western Amazon basin in Ecuador and Peru. This species is traditionally placed in Brochis but the genus is a synonym of Corydoras.[1][2] FishBase continues to recognize Brochis as a valid genus.[3] The fish has about 17 dorsal fin rays as compared with the 11 or 12 commonly seen in Corydoras splendens. The snout is considerably longer than other species in the genus which explains the common name. The fish will grow in length up to 6.7 centimetres (2.6 inches).[citation needed] The hog-nosed catfish lives in a tropical climate in water with a 6.0\u20137.2 pH, a water hardness of 15 dGH, and a temperature range of 21\u201324\u00a0\u00b0C (70\u201375\u00a0\u00b0F).

It originates in coastal drainages in South America from Rio de Janeiro to Santa Catarina, Brazil.[2] It was originally described as Callichthys barbatus by Jean Ren\u00e9 Constant Quoy & Joseph Paul Gaimard in 1824, from which it was transferred to genus Corydoras as Corydoras barbatus, a name which by which it is still being referred to in the aquarium industry. The species was further transferred to genus Scleromystax in 2003.[3] The fish will grow in length up to 9.8\u00a0centimetres (3.9\u00a0in).[2] This species has pronounced sexual dimorphism. The dorsal and pectoral fins of males reach, or almost reach, the caudal peduncle, and well-developed odontodes are inserted in fleshy tissue on a large area on the sides of the snout in fully grown males.[4] The banded corydoras lives in a subtropical climate in water with a 6.0\u20138.0 pH, a water hardness of 2\u201325 dGH, and a temperature of 68\u00a0\u00b0F (20\u00a0\u00b0C) to 82\u00a0\u00b0F (28\u00a0\u00b0C).[2] It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. It lays eggs in dense vegetation and adults do not guard the eggs. In captivity, as the sperm are released the female sinks to the bottom, resting on one of her pectoral fins while she starts fanning with the other pectoral fin. At this time, some eggs are released which fall into the pelvic fin basket and are apparently fertilized at that time. The banded corydoras is of commercial importance in the aquarium trade industry. Though peaceful, they get larger than most Corydoras and are therefore less suitable for small aquaria.[5]  This Callichthyidae-related article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it."

        "description": " The bronze corydoras  (Corydoras aeneus), also known as the green corydoras, bronze catfish, lightspot corydoras or wavy catfish, is a species of freshwater fish in the armored catfish family, Callichthyidae, often kept as an aquarium fish. It is widely distributed in South America on the eastern side of the Andes, from Colombia and Trinidad to the R\u00edo de la Plata basin;[2] however, as presently defined it is a species complex and a taxonomic review is necessary.[3] It was originally described as Hoplosoma aeneum (based on a specimen from Trinidad) by Theodore Gill in 1858 and has historically also been referred to as Callichthys aeneus.[2] The adult size is 6\u00bd cm for males and a slightly larger 7\u00a0cm for females (2\u00bd to 2\u00be inches).[4]   Females have a slightly higher body frame than males in accordance with their larger abdominal region. Their average life span is 10 years. It has a yellow or pink body, white belly, and is blue-grey over its head and back. Its fins are yellow or pink and immaculate. In common with most Corydoras the dorsal, pectoral and adipose fins have an additional sharp barb and have a mild poison which causes fish which try to attack them to get stung. A brownish-orange patch is usually present on the head, just before the dorsal fin, and is its most distinctive feature when viewed from above in the stream. Their upper sides are often a greenish color, which is the reason another common name for this fish is the green corydoras. Like many other catfishes, females are larger than males in this species.[5] They are found in quiet, shallow waters with soft bottoms that can sometimes be heavily polluted by clouds of disturbed mud from the bottom, but it also inhabits running waters.[2] In its native habitat, it inhabits waters with a temperature range of 25\u00a0\u00b0C to 28\u00a0\u00b0C (77\u00a0\u00b0F to 82\u00a0\u00b0F), pH 6.0\u20138.0, and hardness 5 to 19 DGH.[2] Like most members of the genus Corydoras, these catfish have a unique method of coping with the low oxygen content that prevails in such environments. In addition to utilizing their gills like any other fish, they rapidly come to the surface of the water and draw air in through their mouth. This air is then absorbed through the wall of the intestine and any surplus air is expelled through the vent.[2] It typically stays in schools of 20 to 30 individuals.[2] It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter.[2] Reproduction occurs with the onset of the rainy season, which changes the water chemistry.[2] Females spawn 10\u201320 egg-clutches with multiple males at a time, but an entire egg clutch is inseminated by the sperm of a single male.[5] In laboratory observations, it was found that bronze corydoras have a unique method of insemination. When these fish reproduce, the male will present his abdomen to the female. The female will attach her mouth to the male's genital opening, creating the well-known \"T-position\" many Corydoras exhibit during courtship. The female will then drink the sperm. The sperm rapidly moves through her intestines and is discharged together with her eggs into a pouch formed by her pelvic fins. The female can then swim away and deposit the pouch somewhere else alone. Because the T-position is exhibited in other species than just C. aeneus, it is likely that they also exhibit this behavior.[6] In the wild, eggs are laid on waterweeds.[5] Males do not form territories or compete over females; interference between males might only happen when two males present their abdomens simultaneously. On the other hand, females do not choose between males. Mating is more or less random; therefore, male reproductive success is directly related to courtship frequency.[5] The eggs of C. aeneus exhibit a unique surface pattern with small villi-like protuberances which resemble attaching-filaments of teleost eggs. These structures allow the eggs to be adhesive and stick to a specific place or to each other. The presence of these structures may be related to the turbid habitat in which this species lives.[7] Bronze corydoras are probably the most popular Corydoras species.[8] It is annually bred and shipped in large quantities all over the world[9] It is easily bred and is produced in commercial quantities in the United States, Europe, and Singapore. Most of the available fish are therefore domestic strains. Wild imports are reported to be less easy to breed.[citation needed] They are a hardy and useful aquarium fish despite having a coloration that is by no means striking or unusual. Many aquarists are fascinated by the habits of these fish. They ceaselessly comb the bottom of the aquarium for food and therefore disturb it slightly, sending up detritus and waste material that has settled loosely on the bottom. They prefer being kept in groups of 5 or more, being sociable fish and are ideal fish for a community tank.[2] Other Corydoras species can be placed in the same aquarium, and despite the strong resemblance many species bear to one another, the species will tend to separate out and only move about among their own kind. Corydoras aeneus is not particular about the composition of the water. Adequate conditions are a temperature range of 20 to 28\u00a0\u00b0C (68 to 82\u00a0\u00b0F), pH of 6.0\u20138.0, and hardness of 2\u201330 DGH. The water should have no salt added to it.[8] A fairly dense growth of plants with a number of possible hiding places is greatly appreciated. Corys are easy to feed, they are omnivores eating all flake and pelleted food and also live and frozen foods. When it comes to sperm, then the female glues the eggs, only a few in number, to the chosen substrate and then (sometimes) quickly touches them with her mouth. After several acts of spawning, which span a total of two to three hours, one female will have produced up to 200 eggs. Frequently, two males are used for each female, as one male has difficulty fertilizing all the eggs. The eggs gradually grow darker in color, and just prior to hatching (ranging from three days at 28\u00a0\u00b0C to a week at 20\u00a0\u00b0C) they turn dark brown. The fry keep to the bottom of the tank, feeding on detritus and any fine foods available. The parents may spawn again within two to three weeks. The albino corydoras is an albino variety of the bronze corydoras that has been developed for the aquarium trade, with a pale pink or orange body and red eyes.  It is physically similar to normally-colored individuals, although some breeders report that the fry are a little slower to develop.[10] Others say that the albinos are practically blind and that the males are somewhat sterile, although this may be due to extensive inbreeding.[11] Albino bronze corydoras are frequently injected with bright dye (via a needle) and sold in aquariums. This controversial practice is known as \"painting\" or \"juicing\" fish."

        "description": " The dwarf corydoras (Corydoras hastatus), dwarf catfish, tail spot pygmy catfish, or micro catfish is a tropical freshwater fish belonging to the subfamily Corydoradinae of the family Callichthyidae.  It originates in inland waters in South America, and is found in the Amazon River and Paraguay River basins in Argentina, Bolivia, and Brazil.[1] The specific epithet hastatus means with a spear, in reference to the spearhead-like spot on the tail root. The body of Corydoras hastatus is typically more elongated than other Corydoras species.  Its body is a translucent white to olive color, with a thin dark stripe on the sides from behind the gill cover to the root of the tail, and a whitish belly.  It has a white crescent at the base of the tail surrounding a black spot.  The fish will grow in length up to 1.4 inches (3.5\u00a0cm), but 1.0 inch (2.5\u00a0cm) is more typical.  Males are smaller, more slender and have a more pointed dorsal fin than females. The dwarf corydoras lives in a (sub)tropical climate in water with a 6.0\u20138.0 pH, a water hardness of 5\u201319 dGH, and a temperature range of 68\u201382 F (20\u201328\u00a0\u00b0C).[1] It is found in ponds.[1] It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. They are found in the Paraguay River and Amazon River basins. C. hastatus lives among plants.[1] It is a schooling species.[1] It differs from most Corydoras species by preferring the midwater areas instead of the bottom, spending most of its time well off the bottom in areas of dense plants.  When it rests, it rests on the leaves of the plants.  Other Corydoras species with similar mid-water habits include C. habrosus and C. pygmaeus. The dwarf Corydoras maintains its position in a current by using rapid fin movements, especially with its pectoral fins. These rapid movements, combined with a high breathing rate, give the fish the appearance of being very \"nervous\" when compared with other fish. C. hastatus may even shoal with small characins. The fish lays its eggs in dense vegetation and the adults do not guard the eggs.  The female holds a single egg between her pelvic fins, where the male fertilizes them for about 30 seconds.  Only then does the female swim to a suitable spot, where she attaches the sticky egg. The pair repeats this process about every three minutes for from one to two hours with some 10- to 15-minute rests between egg releases.  Around 7 to 15 eggs are spawned in a single day, and spawning occurs on three to four consecutive days. A total of 30 to 60 eggs may be spawned by a single female over this period of time. The eggs hatch in three to nine days.  The fry are about 6\u00a0mm long at hatching, mostly translucent but sometimes with spots. In two months, the fry average about 18\u00a0mm in length.  The fry mature in six to eight months. The dwarf corydoras is of commercial importance in the aquarium trade industry.   Due to its small size, this fish can be kept in a relatively small aquarium; a 5-gallon (20 litre) tank is sufficient for a small school.  Since it is a schooling fish, it should only be kept in groups of at least six individuals.  It is a good community tank fish when kept with peaceful tankmates such as tetras, rasboras, and danios, but should not be kept with overly aggressive tankmates.  They have also been used as scavengers for fry tanks. The aquarium should be clean, well-aerated, and densely planted to provide hiding places.  A moderate current provided by a power filter or canister filter is appreciated.  The water should be slightly alkaline (pH about 7.6) within a temperature range of 24\u00b0 to 29\u00a0\u00b0C.  Although the fish is generally a mid-water dweller, a fine gravel or sand substrate should be provided since it will occasionally burrow. The fish will feed both in midwater or on a substrate, whether that substrate is a plant leaf, a broad rock, or the bottom of the tank.  It accepts most foods, including freeze-dried, flake, and frozen foods, although live foods are particularly appreciated. The methods of spawning this fish in the aquarium is similar to spawning most other Corydoras species.  The spawning tank can be as small as 2.5 gallons (10 L), but at least a 5-gallon (20 L) tank is recommended with aged water, a sponge filter and some plants.  Fish should be conditioned with large amounts of live foods such as Tubifex and whiteworms, during which time the females will become noticeably plumper.  Since C. hastatus may spawn as a school, the whole group can be conditioned for spawning at the same time, and for best results, there should be at least two males for every female. Spawning of well-conditioned fish may be initiated by the addition of cooler water.  During spawning, very little food is accepted, but the fish will immediately search for food after finishing.  It will typically attach its eggs to the plants in the aquarium, but if not enough plants are available, the sides of the aquarium may be used.  When the fry hatch, they can be fed newly hatched brine shrimp or microworms.  The parents may be ready to spawn again in a couple of weeks."

The fish's appearance is characterized by dark double longitudinal stripes. The dorsal fin is ornamented by a few gray dots, taking on an arching pattern in some individuals. The body has other gray and black markings on an olive background. Compared with other species of Corydoras, the body is not as tall in comparison to its length, and its eyes are set a bit lower. The fish will grow in length up to 5.1 centimetres (2.0 inches). It lives in a tropical climate in water with a 6.0 - 8.0 pH, a water hardness of 2 \u2013 25 dGH, and a temperature range of 22\u201326\u00a0\u00b0C (72\u201379\u00a0\u00b0F). It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. Though it lays eggs in dense vegetation, adults do not guard them. In captivity, the male is reportedly territorial during the prespawning activities while the female is usually hidden among the plant roots. Both sexes clean the underside of plant leaves. Eggs are fastened under the leaves and are also attached to roots of plants. The elegant corydoras is of commercial importance in the aquarium trade industry. It tends to swim in the upper levels of the aquarium, instead of at the bottom as is common with most species of Corydoras, and does not seem to disturb the sediment as much."

        "description": " Corydoras reticulatus, also called the reticulated corydoras, mosaic corydoras, network catfish, or network corydoras, is a tropical freshwater fish belonging to the Corydoradinae sub-family of the family Callichthyidae.  It originates in inland waters in South America, and is found in the Lower Amazon River basin in Brazil. The fish grows up to 2.4 inches (6.1 centimeters) in length.  It lives in a tropical climate in water with a 6.0\u20138.0 pH, a water hardness of 2\u201325 dGH, and a temperature range of 72\u201379\u00a0\u00b0F (22\u201326\u00a0\u00b0C).  It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter.  It lays eggs in dense vegetation and adults do not guard the eggs.  The female holds 2\u20134 eggs between her pelvic fins, where the male fertilizes them for about 30 seconds.  Only then does the female swim to a suitable spot, where she attaches the very sticky eggs. The pair repeats this process until about 100 eggs have been fertilized and attached. The reticulated corydoras is of commercial importance in the aquarium trade industry.  This Callichthyidae-related article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it."

        "description": " Corydoras panda is a species of catfish belonging to the genus Corydoras, of the family Callichthyidae, and is a native member of the riverine fauna of South America.  It is found in Peru and Ecuador, most notably in the Hu\u00e1nuco region, where it inhabits the R\u00edo Aquas, the R\u00edo Amarillae, a tributary of the R\u00edo Pachitea, and the R\u00edo Ucayali river system. The species was first collected by Randolph H. Richards in 1968, and was named Corydoras panda by Nijssen and Isbr\u00fccker in 1971. The specific name is an allusion to the appearance of the fish, which possesses large black patches surrounding the eyes, reminiscent of those found on the giant panda. Accordingly, the common names for this fish, which is a popular aquarium species, are panda corydoras and panda catfish. Corydoras panda has an off-white to pinkish-orange ground colour, and when observed under certain lighting conditions, a faint greenish iridescence is present upon the flanks and the operculum. The fins of the fish match the body in ground colour, upon close inspection being seen to be hyaline or translucent with coloured fin rays, with the dorsal fin being marked by a conspicuous black blotch that covers almost the entire fin area. The caudal peduncle is marked with a black band, this black band encircling the caudal peduncle from dorsal to ventral surface. The adipose fin, supported by a small fin spine, sometimes contains black pigmentation. The head is the same ground colour as the body, with a black mask surrounding the eyes, descending vertically from the fontanel, over each eye, and ending in a triangular wedge immediately before the ventral surface of the head. The pectoral fins are positioned immediately behind the operculum, and are usually oriented horizontally when the fish is at rest, extended in a manner similar to the wings of an aeroplane. The pelvic fins are positioned upon the ventral surface of the fish, located some way behind the pectoral fins. The first ray of the dorsal fin emanates from the body at approximately its point of greatest elevation, and a vertical line drawn downwards from this point meets the attachment point of the pelvic fins. The anal fin is located far to the rear of the ventral surface of the body, the attachment point of the first fin ray being somewhat forward of the black caudal peduncle marking described above. In common with all other members of the family Callichthyidae, the body surface is covered, not with scales, but with bony plates known as scutes. The lines of demarcation between individual scutes can be seen upon close examination of this and almost all other Callichthyid fishes, and in the case of some specimens of this species, are highlighted by additional black pigment. The fish possesses, in common with almost all Corydoras species, three pairs of barbels\u2014one pair of maxillary barbels and two pairs of rictal barbels. A fully mature adult specimen of this species attains a standard length of 55 millimetres (2.1\u00a0inches): this is the length attained by mature females, which grow larger than mature males, and also possess more rounded body outlines. Corydoras panda inhabits clear river waters that are relatively fast-flowing, well-oxygenated, and flowing over substrates that may comprise soft sand or fine gravel. These rivers are usually well vegetated with assorted species of aquatic plants. The proximity of the home rivers of the fish to the Andes mountain range, and the replenishment of those rivers with meltwaters from Andean snows at higher altitudes, has led the fish to be adaptable to cooler temperatures than the norm for 'tropical' fishes\u2014the temperature range of the fish is 16\u00a0\u00b0C to 28\u00a0\u00b0C, though the fish exhibits a marked preference for the cooler regions of this temperature spectrum, particularly in captivity. Indeed, the fish can, for small time-periods, survive temperatures as low as 12\u00a0\u00b0C, though captive rearing at such low temperatures is ill-advised. The native waters of Corydoras panda are consequently mineral-deficient, with a neutral to slightly acid pH, and replication of such conditions in captivity are recommended for successful maintenance. Corydoras panda has a preference for cooler than normal waters when compared to many other popular tropical fish species. Because of this, those who keep C. panda in community aquarium setting must choose tankmates that share its preference for cooler temperatures of around 20\u00a0\u00b0C (68\u00a0\u00b0F) to 25\u00a0\u00b0C (77\u00a0\u00b0F).[2] Given the cleanliness of the fish's native waters, scrupulous attention to water quality in the aquarium is considerably more important for this fish than for the more domesticated Corydoras species such as C. paleatus or C. aeneus. Additionally, scrupulous attention to aquarium substrate cleanliness is a must, as the fish are intolerant of poor aquarium maintenance in this area, and succumb to stress and disease rapidly if their aquaria are not kept to a high standard. Despite this, the species remains highly popular with aquarists, upon account of the appearance of the fish, and its lively, vivacious behaviour in a well-planned aquarium setting. Like many other Corydoras species, the panda catfish is a highly gregarious fish, and in common with several other smaller Corydoras species such as C. habrosus and C. pygmaeus, manifests a distinct need for numerous companions of its own species in order to thrive, and can thus be described as being more avowedly social than some of the larger members of the genus. A minimum of eight individuals should be housed in the same aquarium, and if space permits, this number should be revised upwards, as the fish exhibits a very definite preference for grouping together with others of its species. They also associate themselves easily with the clown loach and school together in currents where sufficient numbers of their own species is lacking. An aquarium for this species should be well furnished, ideally with a mixture of live aquatic plants, and solid furnishings providing caves, sheltered areas and hiding places to give the fish security. Floating plants to provide additional areas of shade are also welcomed by the fish. Like all Corydoras species, the fish feeds primarily upon animal matter. The aquarist is advised, however, that the traditional use of Corydoras catfishes as putative 'scavengers' in an aquarium setting will be detrimental to the well-being of this species\u2014it requires high quality foods for long-term maintenance, and a varied diet. Ideally, the fish should be given live foods at least intermittently, and will dine enthusiastically upon such items as Bloodworms (larvae of Chironomus midges), Daphnia, cultivated Brine Shrimp (Atermia salina), and Tubifex worms. The last, however, should be cultivated in order to minimise the risk of introducing pathogenic organisms to the aquarium, as Tubifex live in unsanitary conditions in the wild. Freeze dried Tubifex may be preferable, as the risk of introduction of disease is eliminated. High quality flake foods are also appreciated, particularly those containing shrimp or other similar matter. The lifespan of Corydoras panda in the aquarium has not been systematically determined, but given the longevity of other Corydoras species in the aquarium, it is reasonable to assume that well-cared for specimens will enjoy a lifespan in excess of ten years, and frequently in excess of 15 years. Corydoras panda follows, with a few minor deviations, the standard model for breeding for the genus. Stimulus for breeding consists of the influx of cooler, oxygenated waters into their habitat, usually corresponding in the wild with the onset of the rainy season. However, while some Corydoras species require a temperature drop in the aquarium for spawning to be stimulated, in the case of Corydoras panda, the temperature drop appears to matter much less, as specimens have spawned in the aquarium without a temperature drop. The addition of new, clean, oxygenated water appears to be the primary stimulus for this species. In the wild, the appearance of new water courtesy of the rains is followed by an increase in the populations of assorted food organisms, and feeding upon these conditions the fishes for breeding. Once conditioned fish are stimulated into spawning, males begin chasing females energetically. Females begin developing eggs within their reproductive tracts, and when 'ripe' (laden with eggs), become receptive to the attentions of the males. Eventually, one male will succeed in courting a female, using his barbels to provide stimulation to the female, usually beginning with caresses of the female's caudal peduncle, followed by caresses of the fontanel and the front of the head. if the female is receptive, then the male positions himself before the female, so that the female's mouth is in close proximity with one of the male's pectoral fins. The male then clasps the female's barbels between the pectoral fin and the body, and this stimulates the female to press against the male's side. When seen from above, the fish form a 'T' shape when conjoined thus, hence the term 'T position' has become conventional in aquarium circles when describing the breeding of Corydoras catfishes. Once the male and female are in the 'T position', the pressing of the female against the male's body stimulates his release of sperm. Though the exact mechanism of fertilisation has yet to be scientifically documented, from the observations of aquarists who have been successful in breeding Corydoras catfishes, it seems likely that the female takes the male's sperm through her mouthparts, and directs them through the gills, in a current that carries the sperm to her pelvic fins. At this point, the female releases a single egg (occasionally two), and purses her pelvic fins in order to provide a receptacle for the freshly extruded egg, which is then fertilised. One difference observed between the adoption of the 'T position' in Corydoras panda, when compared to other Corydoras species, is that the exercise is frequently more acrobatic in appearance, with the 'T position' being adopted in mid-water, some distance above the substrate, rather than resting upon the substrate as is the case with the majority of other Corydoras. Once the female is carrying a fertilised egg within her pelvic fins, she then seeks an egg deposition site. The choice of such a site is frequently, though not always, a mass of fine leaved aquatic vegetation. In the aquarium, the plant known as Java moss, Vesicularia dubayana, is of considerable utility as an egg repository for Corydoras catfishes, even though the plant is not a South American native, and panda catfish females will choose large clumps of this plant readily as safe deposition sites for fertilised eggs. The female is frequently pursued by one or more males as she seeks the deposition site, each male presumably seeking to be the chosen mate to fertilise the next egg. Up to 25 eggs may be produced by a single female during a single spawning, which may take place over four to five hours. Fertile Corydoras panda eggs require approximately 3\u20134 days development time before hatching, if kept at a temperature of 22\u00a0\u00b0C. This development time will vary with temperature, taking longer in cooler water. Upon hatching, the fry are four millimetres long, translucent, but already possessing the basic ground colour of the species, and upon close examination, possess fully formed barbels. Even newly hatched fry possess at least some hint of the adult eye patches, and as the fry grow, these patches darken and become more prominent. Even so, at just four millimetres in length, the fry are practically invisible against typical aquarium gravel unless seen to move. The fry take approximately four weeks to develop to the point where the finfold, a continuous undifferentiated membrane resembling that seen at the posterior of a tadpole, has differentiated into the unpaired fins (dorsal, anal and caudal fins). During this time, size will have increased to approximately eight or nine millimetres, and the fish will begin to develop colour changes leading to that of the adult fish. From this point, the caudal peduncle patch and dorsal fin patch will begin to appear, but the body will also be seen to be covered in fine black 'pepper dots' between these black patches. Only after a period of 10 to 12 weeks, at which point the fish has assumed a size of 12 to 14 millimetres, will the fish attain the colouration of the adult, and be in all respects a perfect miniature of the parents. Fry of this species are particularly sensitive to changes in water chemistry and to elevated temperatures. While adult fishes can withstand temperatures of 28\u00a0\u00b0C, fry will die of heat stress if exposed to temperatures above 26\u00a0\u00b0C, and their chances of survival are enhanced if the water temperature is kept at 22\u00a0\u00b0C or below. Water changes made to a nursery aquarium during the first 21 days of life of the fry\u2014the critical period during which they manifest the greatest sensitivity to their environment\u2014must be gradual, and the incoming water conditioned to match that of the existing aquarium water where possible before the water change takes place. While the fry are likely to develop best if given infusoria as part of their feeding r\u00e9gime, it is possible to raise fry to adulthood entirely upon prepared foods."

        "description": " Corydoras paleatus is a species of catfish (order Siluriformes) of the family Callichthyidae. Its common names include blue leopard corydoras, mottled corydoras, and peppered catfish.[1] It originates from the lower Paran\u00e1 River basin and coastal rivers in Uruguay and Brazil.[1] This fish species reach about 5.9 - 7 centimeters (2.3 - 2.75 \u00a0in) SL.[1] The male is smaller than the female, and in proportion to body length, the dorsal fin and pectoral fins are longer on the male than the female.[2] Corydoras paleatus is found in the Amazon basin,[1] and feeds on worms, crustaceans, insects, and plant matter.[1] C. paleatus has been known to produce sound; it does this by the abduction of its pectoral fins. This is used by males during courtship and intrapersonal communication, and by both sexes and juveniles when distressed.[2] In reproduction, males do not behave aggressively toward each other, nor do they monopolize mating areas or females.[2] The T-position is involved in courtship, as with many other Corydoras species.[2] Charles Darwin discovered the C. paleatus when he went to Buenos Aires during his expedition aboard the Beagle during the 1830s.[3] It is a very good choice for the community aquarium, as it is a hardy,[4] good-looking, and peaceful fish.[4] They can be successfully kept with other small, peaceful aquarium fish like livebearers, danios, and tetras. It is sometimes seen in the shops as an albino form, although this is similar to other albino corys (see the C. aeneus albino form). It grows to around 7.5\u00a0cm and is easily bred at home. These fish prefer a planted tank with temperatures around 16 to 24 \u00b0C (61 \u2013 75 \u00b0F), although they can take lower temperatures than this as it originates from colder waters.[3] Their high temperature tolerance seems poor, and 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F) is the highest safe temperature. They like to nibble on the algae that grow on floating plants but are not specialized algae-eating catfish. The lighting must not be too bright, and hiding places, such as bogwood, are needed as they like to hide from the light during certain parts of the day. Heavily planted areas should also be provided, where the light is minimized, as they like darker areas due to their bottom-feeding nature. Diet should be sinking pellets, algae wafers, frozen and live food, such as bloodworm or daphnia. They may also occasionally enjoy blanched spinach, which can be attached to plants with a peg or the side of the glass with magnetic clips. They can be seen to dart to the top of the tank: this is because they can use atmospheric oxygen to supplement what their gills extract from the water.[5] They will do this more frequently  when water quality is starting to deteriorate, and so should be watched for this indication. Peppered corydoras reach their sexual maturity and start to show reproductive behaviors once the females reach an average (minimum) size of 5.625 cm (2.214 inches) and once the males reach about 4.875 cm (1.919 inches).[citation needed] The males initiate the courtship ritual, which entails chasing the females around the tank. The female darts away, and the males search for her and find her a few moments later. The males shiver all over the female and may lie down on top of her. When she is ready to spawn, she turns to the male next to her and pounds below his ventral fin. The pair go into the \"T-position\" with the male releasing the sperm into the female's mouth before the sperm fertilizes the eggs[citation needed]. The female cups her ventral fins and lays a few eggs (usually between 4 and 12 eggs[citation needed]) in her fins.  The eggs are about 1.8 mm in diameter[citation needed]. The female now starts cleaning a spot on the glass to put her eggs on. Corydoras are egg depositors and lay their eggs all over the aquarium. Favorite spots include the heater, filters, and the glass, although, occasionally eggs are also laid on plants and driftwood. After depositing a group of eggs closely together, the female rests for a few moments. The males regroup and start chasing each other and then resume chasing the female. The males are so relentless in this pursuit that they try to mate with the female even while she is busy laying her eggs. The spawning lasts more than an hour, and many eggs are laid in different places. On average, about 50 to 150 eggs are laid during a single spawning[citation needed]. The incubation period for the eggs for peppered corydoras was found to be between 96 hours and 113 hours at 24\u00b12\u00b0C, with the average incubation period being about 102 hours (or 4.25 days)[citation needed]. In one study, the average hatching ratio of the eggs was found to be approximately 87%, with the overall egg-laying period lasting between 20 and 35 days[citation needed]. Peppered cories can eat their eggs, but will not eat the living fry.  At first, the fry is small (with a mean length of 7.5246 mm[citation needed]) and is unable to eat, sustaining themselves on the last of their yolk sacs. The fry will begin to eat 1\u20133 days after hatching, and will eat the protozoan organisms in the tank and can be fed powdered food at this stage.  By about one month, the fry will start to become rounder and will begin developing adult coloration, eventually becoming miniature versions of the adults[citation needed]. The juveniles will reach adult size at around 1 year of age, although this varies between individuals and how well they are kept. The age of sexual maturity also varies between individuals, but juveniles will typically begin breeding at around 8\u201312 months of age. However, they can begin as early as 6 months and as late as 18 months of age. From the onset of sexual maturity, it can take the fish up to another year to successfully produce fertile eggs; at first, entire clutches of eggs may be infertile. Albino strains may develop slower and be less fertile due to inbreeding. Media related to Corydoras paleatus at Wikimedia Commons"

        "description": " Corydoras pygmaeus, or the pygmy corydoras or pygmy catfish[1] is a tropical and freshwater fish belonging to the subfamily Corydoradinae of the family Callichthyidae. It originates in tropical inland waters in South America, and is found in the Madeira River basin in Brazil. The first scientific description of the pygmy corydoras was published in 1966 by German biologist and physician Joachim Knaack, in Aquarien und Terrarien-Zeitschrift.[2][3] One specimen was designated the holotype and one additional specimen was collected as a paratype.[2] The scientific name uses the Latin word pygmaeus, meaning dwarf or pygmy.[4] A species of Corydoras with a similar appearance, Corydoras hastatus was described in the 1880s, and many specimens that were described as Corydoras hastatus between the 1920s and 1950s were subsequently found to be misidentified specimens of the pygmy corydoras.[1] In older literature, the pygmy corydoras is frequently mislabeled due to Corydoras hastatus being the only miniature Corydoras species known at the time.[1] The pygmy corydoras is a silver-colored fish, with an unbroken black line that runs horizontally along the center of the sides of the fish from the tip of its snout to its caudal peduncle.[5] It has a second thin black line along the lower part of the side of the body, from behind the ventral fins and continuing into the tail.[5] The top part of the body has a light black or dark gray shading that starts on the top of its snout and ends at the tail.[5] Newly hatched fry have vertical stripes along the sides of their bodies that fade by the end of their first month, when the horizontal stripes of the adult fish begin to appear.[5] The maximum length of the species is about 3.2 centimeters (1.3\u00a0in),[6] but typical adult sizes are 1.9 centimeters (0.75\u00a0in) for males and 2.5 centimeters (1.0\u00a0in) for females.[1] In addition to their larger length, females are also rounder and broader than males, especially when they have eggs.[7] Young fry grow rapidly after hatching, reaching 13 millimeters (0.51\u00a0in) in six to eight weeks.[1] The pygmy corydoras is widely distributed in inland waters in Peru in tributaries of the Nanay River, in Ecuador in tributaries of the Aguarico River, and in western Brazil in tributaries of the Madeira River.[8] The holotype was obtained from Calama, Brazil, along the Madeira River near the mouth of the Ji-Paran\u00e1 River.[6] The pygmy corydoras lives in a tropical climate in water with a 6.0 - 8.0 pH,[9] a water hardness of 2 \u2013 25 dGH,[9] and a temperature range of 22\u201326\u00a0\u00b0C (72\u201379\u00a0\u00b0F).[9] It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. The pygmy corydoras lays approximately 100 eggs at a time.[9] The female holds 2\u20134 eggs at a time in a pouch formed by her pelvic fins while they are fertilized by the male, which takes about 30 seconds.[9] The female swims to a safe location with the fertilized eggs, where she attaches the sticky eggs to a surface, where they will remain.[9] It is a peaceful fish, shoaling fish and can be kept in a community aquarium of smaller fish species such as ember tetras. It can be fed most sinking foods, flakes, frozen food and sinking wafers. It can be kept with small shrimp and snails. In aquariums, they are often kept on fine grained substrate, such as sand. This enables them to dig through the substrate without injury to their barbels, which can often be lost in sharp substrates. They are often kept at a pH of between 6.5 and 7.0. They are schooling fish that are usually kept in groups of at least four and will also behave much more naturally in larger groups (10 or more). Unlike the larger more common Corydoras, they often swim in shoals around the mid water and lower regions of the tank. C. pygmaeus are peaceful fish which will not thrive with aggressive tankmates. They are perhaps best kept in a planted species tank, or with shrimp such as Neocaridina spp. They seem to do best when offered live foods in addition to prepared food items. Appropriate foods include microworms or similar nematodes, as well as Artemia nauplii (newly hatched brine shrimp)."

It originates in inland waters in South America, and is found in the Upper Orinoco River basin in Venezuela and Colombia. C. habrosus, is often found in periodic wetlands, large floodplains to where other species migrate seasonally. These small corydoras are prone to entrapment in receding waters, and populations can suffer during the dry season.[2] Their natural habitat tends to be abundant in leaf litter and plant life, providing ample cover to allow these fish to roam moderately freely. As a bottom dwelling species C. habrosus tends to stick to the lower regions of the river, however, on occasion corydoras will dart up to the water surface to take in air. They use their intestines as an air breathing organ to absorb oxygen, and expel the remnant air out of the anus.[3] The fish will grow in length up to 1.4 inches (3.5 centimeters). It lives in a tropical climate in water with a 5.5 \u2013 7.5 pH, a water hardness of 2 \u2013 10 dGH, and a temperature of about 77\u00a0\u00b0F (25\u00a0\u00b0C).[4] The diet consists of worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. It is a peaceful fish and can be kept in a community aquarium of smaller fish species such as ember tetras, clown panchax, endler guppies and small species of rasbora.  It should be kept in groups of at least 6 individuals, ideally 10 or more. A shoal should be kept in a tank that is at least 14 gallons in size.[5] Salt and pepper catfish can be fed most small sinking foods including pellets, flake food and preserved baby brine shrimp. Frozen foods such as baby brine shrimp, rotifers and cyclops can also be fed either regularly or exclusively. In captivity, breeding can be difficult to achieve. Some aquarists report that large water changes with relatively cold water can stimulate habrosus in to spawning.[6] Spawning is marked by obvious behaviours; males will swim close to the female, if multiple males are present they will surround the female swimming from side to side quickly. The female holds an egg visibly under her ventral fin ready for fertilising. The female can then be seen to 'massage' the males belly. The female will then choose an appropriate place to deposit her egg, usually on plants near the substrate, particularly on the underside of the leaves but can also be found on the aquarium glass and decor.  Eggs are rarely placed on the top of the leaves or close to the water surface. The spawning male will protect the female from other males attempting to spawn with her.

        "description": " Sterba's corydoras (Corydoras sterbai) is a member of the South American Corydoras genus of freshwater aquarium catfish and one of the most popular species of Corydoras due to its attractive markings. The fish is native to the Guapor\u00e9 River region between Bolivia and Brazil.[1] Sterba's cory is distinguishable from other Corydoras species as it has white spots on a black background on its head. It is occasionally confused with Corydoras haraldschultzi; the difference is that the latter has a pattern of black dots on a white background on the head.  C. sterbai has recently become available in an albino form and a black form. Like many Corydoras species, Sterba's corydoras is a shoaling catfish, and thus should ideally be kept in groups of 5 or more. In the wild it can be found in Brazil and thus, wild caught fish prefer soft, acidic water. However, Sterba's corydoras is a hardy fish and tank bred specimens have adapted to a wider range of water conditions. However, like almost all fish it will not tolerate high levels of nitrates. Unlike some other catfish they are not good algae eaters, but are good at \"cleaning up\" leftover food and detritus from the substrate. Corydoras sterbai are relatively small for catfish, growing to a maximum size of only 2\u20132.6 inches (5.1\u20136.6\u00a0cm). In captivity Corydoras sterbai readily accepts a wide variety of prepared and frozen foods. Flake food is a good staple diet (which will only be consumed once it has fallen to the bottom) as are sinking pellets or wafers. They relish live and frozen foods such as bloodworm, daphnia and mosquito larvae, but ideally should only be fed such foods once a week due to the high amount of protein in them. It is often problematic to feed Corydoras in aquaria with fast feeding mid-water fish such as tetras as flake and sinking pellets are consumed by such fish before they have hit the bottom and sometimes, even while lying on the substrate. However, this problem can be overcome by placing pellets and flake on the aquarium substrate in caves or under bogwood, or other such areas which are not regularly frequented by mid-water fish. The compatibility of C. sterbai is one of their main selling points as with all other Corydoras species as they are very peaceful catfish and can be kept with other peaceful fish. They should not be kept with overly aggressive bottom dwellers, particularly if there is competition over substrate space as there would be in small tanks or tanks with a large amount of \"furniture\". Ideal companions would be similar sized tetras or particularly, dwarf cichlids. Ideally Corydoras sterbai should be housed with a fine substrate such as sand or gravel in order to avoid doing damage to their delicate barbels. However, large gravel will suffice as long as it is not sharp edged. Their only other requirement is that shade be provided for them, by means of overhanging rock, large leaved plants, arching bogwood or caves. Breeding is not too difficult. A tank with dimensions 18\u2033 x 12\u2033 x 12\u2033 (10 US Gallon) is recommended. The breeding ratio that should be kept is 2 males per female. Good diet together with repeated water changes and drops of temperature are usually sufficient. However, raising the fry is not easy due to its high sensitivity. Occasionally problems can arise while transporting these fish as they are capable of secreting a chemical toxin when stressed or overcrowded. For this reason they are never shipped with other fish. The species name of this Corydoras is in honour of Professor Dr. G\u00fcnther Sterba, professor emeritus of zoology of Leipzig University, member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.[2] Professor Sterba is a professional ichthyologist who nevertheless produced several very popular books regarded as virtual bibles for fishkeepers over the 1970s and 1980s, translated into English under the titles Freshwater Fishes of the World, Aquarium Care and (with Dick Mills) The Aquarists' Encyclopedia, despite his degree of isolation at that time by virtue of living in the then German Democratic Republic."

It is often confused with Corydoras trilineatus,[3] the three stripe corydoras. Corydoras julii are small, peaceful shoaling fish, and are typically kept in groups in captivity.[4] Corydoras julii is a relatively small species of fish, growing to be no more than 52 millimeters in length.[5] Its skin is a translucent whitish-gray, with fine black spotting across the body and a horizontal stripe which reaches up the mid-body until it is equal with the front base of the dorsal fin. This spotting pattern is the primary visual difference between C. julii and three stripe corydoras (C. trilineatus), which have larger reticulations, as opposed to spots, and a longer mid-body stripe. C. julii might be further distinguished from C. trilineatus by the spotted pattern on its head; however, C. trilineatus can also show this pattern on occasion.[5] Females are typically larger and rounder than males.[6] Corydoras julii, like almost all Corydoras species, are bottom-feeding scavengers. Their diet consists primarily of small invertebrates which they sift from the substrate, expelling the particles of sand and sediment through their gill openings. In captivity, their diet is frequently sinking pellets rich in insect and other invertebrate proteins, as well as live or frozen invertebrates like bloodworms, daphnia, brine shrimp, and California blackworms (Lumbriculus variegatus).[4] After sexual maturity, Corydoras spawning appears to be triggered by storms.[6] During this storm, the fish eat increased amounts of insects. The water gradually decreases temperature over the course of a few days.[6] Corydoras fish breed in a position resembling a \"T formation\". In this formation, the female swims up to the male's abdomen, and consumes sperm released by the male. The sperm rapidly travels though the female's intestinal tract and fertilizes the eggs in the cloaca. Small, white, sturdy eggs are laid on plant leaves in the wild. Adult corydoras have been known to eat their own eggs.[6]"

It was originally described as Silurus callichthys by Linnaeus in 1758.[1] It is likely to represent a species complex.[2] C. callichthys is distributed in all major river drainages of South America.[2] It is very wide-ranging, extending from Trinidad to  Buenos Aires, Argentina, including the upper Amazon River and Paraguay River systems. The fish will grow in length up to eight inches (20 centimeters).  The females are larger and more robust, and are a dull olive-green, while the males are brighter in color, exhibiting a delicate blue or violet sheen laterally, with a more developed and longer pectoral fin spine that is reddish-brown and edged with orange or reddish-orange. It lives in a variety of water types, from anoxic conditions (slack water zones surrounded by dense vegetation) to slightly turbid, but free-flowing, streams.[1] It can be found in waters with pH range of 5.8 to 8.3, a water hardness of 0\u201330dGH, and a temperature range of 64\u201383\u00a0\u00b0F (18\u201328\u00a0\u00b0C).[1] When its biotype becomes dry, it can move out of the water, due to its ability to swallow air and use its intestines to absorb oxygen from the atmosphere, to find more water.[1] It feeds at night on fish, insects, and plant matter.  Juveniles feed on rotifers, in addition to the microcrustaceans and aquatic insect larvae they find when digging into the substrate.[1] During reproduction, the male's belly turns orange and its pectoral spines become longer and thicker.  The male builds a bubble nest with some floating plants, fiercely guarding it after the female lays down her eggs.[1] The cascarudo is of commercial importance in the aquarium trade industry and of minor importance as a food source.[1] It can be kept in aquariums, with groups of more than five individuals recommended.[1]"

        "description": " Megalechis thoracata (black marble hoplo, spotted hoplo[1]) is a species of catfish of the family Callichthyidae.  M. thoracata is found east of the Andes in the Amazon, Orinoco, and upper Paraguay River basins, as well as in the coastal rivers of the Guianas and northern Brazil. Recent introductions were recorded in the upper Paran\u00e1 River drainage.[2] Overview: The Spotted Hoplo Catfish is an incredibly hardy and relatively easy species to keep in captivity, with the main difficulty being the maximum size of around 6 inches, or 15\u00a0cm.They are a very peaceful fish, with the only exception being when the males are guarding a bubble nest at breeding time. They can be kept with almost all tankmates, but they will likely eat anything that can fit in their mouths due to their opportunistic nature. This rule also applies for larger fish, as the Hoplo may get eaten or have its barbels or fins damaged by large, potentially aggressive fish, such as South American Cichlids, African Cichlids, larger catfish and most larger fish species that can fit the Hoplo in its mouth or shows aggression. Tank Setup: They require a soft sand substrate, as they are bottom dwellers that can often be observed foraging/searching for food. A gentle substrate is essential, as other coarse grained or abrasive substrates can irritate the fish's sensitive barbels, and even cause them to fall off. To thrive in the aquarium, they need a minimum tank size of 55 US liquid gallons, but as a rule of thumb for this fish, the larger the tank, the better.[3][4] They are semi-social creatures that prefer to be kept in groups of at least five, but still seem content alone or in pairs. The spotted hoplo catfish needs hiding places, usually in the form of rocks, wood and plants, such as variations of Anubias, valisineria, java fern and micranthemum. Floating plants are also appreciated, as they provide extra cover. Water Conditions: Despite the Hoplo being a very hardy fish, like all fish they need a mature, cycled tank with the correct parameters for almost all tropical species. As they are a species of tropical fish, the optimal temperature for them is around 24\u201328 degrees Celsius, but they can adapt to temperatures in the 22\u201330 degrees Celsius range, although this is not recommended and over a long period of time this can lead to elevated stress levels, amongst other health concerns. The natural habitat of Megalechis thoracata is slow flowing, low oxygen parts of the  Amazon, Orinoco, and upper Paraguay River basins. For this reason, catfish of the family Callichthyidae among other fish, have developed a unique way of breathing, where the fish will rise to the surface of the water and ingest a small amount of air.[5] The oxygen is then absorbed through the lining of the stomach and intestine. This is known as gastrointestinal respiration. They will feed on small to medium-sized worms and other invertebrates, small fish, and general detritus. M. thoracata has been observed to produce sounds during territorial behavior in males at their nest sites and especially during spawning, and during aggressive behavior in both sexes. M. thoracata males aggressively defend territories against intruders.[6]"

        "description": " Ancistrus is a genus of nocturnal freshwater fish in the family Loricariidae of order Siluriformes, native to freshwater habitats in South America and Panama. Fish of this genus are common in the aquarium trade where they are known as bushynose or bristlenose catfish. In the aquarium hobby they are often referred to as bushynose or bristlenose plecos instead, but this may lead to confusion as \"pleco\" usually is used for Hypostomus plecostomus and its allies and is often used as a catchall term for any loricariids remotely resembling that species. The type species is Ancistrus cirrhosus.[1] This genus is the largest genus within the tribe Ancistrini.[2] The name ancistrus derives from the Ancient Greek agkistron \"hook\"\u00a0\u2013 a reference to the form of the cheek odontodes. The genera Pristiancistrus, Thysanocara and Xenocara are now synonyms of Ancistrus.[2] Ancistrus species show all the typical features of the Loricariidae. This includes a body covered in bony plates and a ventral suckermouth.[3] The feature most commonly associated with the genus are the fleshy tentacles found on the head in adult males; females may possess tentacles along the snout margin but they are smaller and they lack tentacles on the head.[3] Tentacules, tentacles directly associated with odontodes, develop on the pectoral fin spine of the males of some species.[3] Males also have evertible cheek odontodes which are less developed or absent in females. They also lack odontodes along the snout.[2] In comparison with a typical loricariid (pleco), a bristlenose is typically shorter (4\u20136 inches or 15\u00a0cm or less), more flattened and fatter with a comparatively wider head. Colouration is typically mottled brown, grey or black. Small white or yellow spots are common.[2] In contrast to many other loricariid 'plecos' (many of which regularly exceed a foot in captivity), the bristlenose plecos do not usually exceed six inches in length; they can thus be kept in relatively small tanks, contributing to their popularity in the aquarium hobby. Ancistrus species are unusual among vertebrates in possessing an X0 sex-determination system, which is the prevailing method in many lineages of arthropod but is very rare elsewhere in the animal kingdom.[4] Ancistrus is one of the widest ranging Loricariid genera, and representatives are found in most areas where the family in general is present.[2] Many species are found in the rivers and floodplain areas of the Amazon basin, but there are also species elsewhere in tropical South America, as well as species on the island of Trinidad and two species, A. centrolepis and A. chagresi in Panama.[5] Three species are true cavefish (troglobites): A. cryptophthalmus, A. galani and A. formoso.[6][7] These are the only known loricariids that possess adaptions for a subterranean lifestyle, such as reduced pigmentation (appearing overall whitish) and eyes.[6] In the wild, Ancistrus species prefer flowing water, so tanks with flow are typically used when keeping them in captivity. Since they are bottom-dwelling fish, substrate is considered preferable to a bare tank floor. Mixtures of gravel, dirt, and clay are frequently used as substrate for Ancistrus. The aquarium size that is considered by some to be a minimum for fish of this genus is 25 gallons.[8] There are currently 76 recognized species in this genus:[9] The diet of this genus is typical for a Loricariid\u00a0\u2013 algae, aufwuchs, and detritus, with sediment, sand, and gravel presumably ingested accidentally alongside food items.[13][14][15][16][17][18] Despite reports among fish-keepers that they require wood in their diet, no scientific evidence to date supports members of this genus feeding on wood.  Bristlenoses do not school but hide when not feeding, juveniles however are typically found in brightly lit shallows at the water margin making them susceptible to predation by birds. Ancistrus species have the capability of obtaining oxygen through their modified stomach.[19] This allows them to survive in conditions with low oxygen levels.[2] Breeding takes place in hollows, caves and mud holes in banks. Males may clean the inside of the cavity with their suckermouth before allowing the female to approach and inspect the nest.  Courtship includes expanding the dorsal and caudal fins and attempts by the male to escort the female to the nest. While the female inspects the nest, the male keeps close contact.[3] The female may lay 20\u2013200 adhesive eggs, usually to the ceiling of the cavity.[3] The female plays no role in parental care; the male takes care of its young. Males will clean the eggs and the cavity with its fins and mouth. Males inspect eggs to remove diseased or infertile eggs, and aerates the clutch by fanning them with its pectoral and pelvic fins.[3] During this time, a male usually will not leave the cavity to feed, or will leave only occasionally and quickly return.[3] The eggs hatch in 4\u201310 days over a period of 2\u20136 hours; the male guards the eggs for 7\u201310 days after hatching.[3] The fry remain in the cave, attaching to the walls and ceiling with their mouths, absorbing their yolk sac in 2\u20134 days and becoming free swimming.[3] Males of these species are competitive and territorial. Males display to each other by positioning themselves parallel to each other, head to tail, with dorsal and caudal fins erect and cheek odontode spines everted. If this escalates to combat, the males will circle each other and direct attacks at the head.[3] If an intruding male manages to evict another male from the nest, it may cannibalize the other male's young.[3] A male bristlenose may guard several clutches of eggs simultaneously. Females prefer males that are already protecting eggs and may prefer males that are protecting larvae; it has been suggested that the tentacles may act as a fry mimic to attract females, which would allow males without eggs in their nest to compete with males guarding eggs.[3] Several clutches in various states of development from eggs to free-swimming larvae can be found in one nest.[2] These fish are often kept by aquarists, as they are dutiful algae-eaters and smaller in adult size than the common plecos usually seen in pet shops. They reach up to 15\u00a0cm in males, and 12\u00a0cm in females. Their recommended temperature is 23\u201327 degrees Celsius. Their lifespan is up to 12 years. They are hardy animals, tolerant to a wide range of water conditions. They breed easily in captivity, and are compatible with most other freshwater fish. Though typically mottled brown or black-and-grey spotted in color, other species are more exotic\u00a0\u2013 spots of bright yellow on a dark background being a common pattern. Albino variants are also common. The albino morph is not caused by exposure to light during development, it is a morph controlled by genetics.[20] Historically, commonly available species of Ancistrus were Ancistrus cirrhosus and Ancistrus temminckii; other species are now available, though exact identification is difficult. Feeding is easy, bristlenoses will graze on algae/ algae wafers and other surface growing organisms as well as eating algae wafers or tablets, flake food, squash, spinach, cucumber, zucchini, green beans peas and even sliced carrots. They have also been known to accept frozen bloodworms as part of their diet. Aquarium specimens may starve for lack of algae or other plant matter; algae wafers or other low-protein foods are recommended. Keepers should watch for the abdomen to take on a sunken appearance, indicating insufficient nutrition. Sexing is very easy as the female will only occasionally have bristles, around the edge of the chin, whereas the male will have them up the center of the head. Breeding is also possible. Males attract females to a small cave or hollow, then guard eggs after fertilization through hatching (4\u20138 days) until fry are free swimming (4\u20136 days after hatching); the aquarist need only supply a suitable cave, food, and one of each sex. Caution should be taken with the spines (odontodes)\u00a0; although the risk of personal injury is small with this genus, the hooked nature of the odontodes means that a bristlenose may become trapped in non-natural material such as sponge filters and netting."

They inhabit flowing sections of rivers, especially clearwater, in the basins of the Amazon (notably Trombetas, Tapaj\u00f3s, Xingu and Tocantins) and Orinoco (notably Ventuari) in Brazil and Venezuela. The largest species reach up to 34\u00a0cm (13\u00a0in) in total length.[2] Most Baryancistrus are differentiated from other related genera by a membrane connecting their dorsal fin and adipose fin, not present in most other genera.[3] The species of this genus are mainly herbivores and detritivores, but may take other foods in an aquarium setting. Most have probably not been bred in captivity. It is difficult to sex these fish, including adult specimens. These fish are mainly nocturnal, but will also emerge from their hiding places during the day, after some time getting accustomed to the aquarium. Adequate hiding places are recommended for these fish due to their primary nocturnal nature. There are currently eight recognized species in this genus:[2][4] Though there are many types of fish described as Baryancistrus, there are many that yet to be given a true scientific designation, and are only referred to under the L-number system, including the Gold Nuggets. Here is a list of Baryancistrus by L-number designation. The common name and scientific name are included when available, though some of these fish are only commonly referred to by their L-number. For those fish without a scientific name, they are assumed to be Baryancistrus sp. * Note: L200 is also used to refer to Hemiancistrus subviridis, another Loricariid that is very similar in appearance to B. demantoides.

        "description": " Rineloricaria (from the Greek, rhinos meaning nose, and the Latin, lorica meaning cuirass of leather) is a genus of freshwater tropical catfish (order Siluriformes) belonging to the family Loricariidae. They are commonly called whiptail catfish because of the long filament that grows out of the tip of the caudal fin that is characteristic of the genus. With the exception of R. altipinnis from Panama, they are native to the rivers of northern and central South America. Some species are regularly seen in the aquarium trade. This genus was described by Pieter Bleeker in 1862, with R. lima as the type species.[1] This genus is by far one of the most speciose of the subfamily Loricariinae, containing about 30 species.[2] On the other hand, it is one of the least resolved genera.[3] In 2008, 14 new species were added to this genus.[2][4][5][6][7] Hemiloricaria, Fonchiiichthys, and Leliella been variably considered synonyms of Rineloricaria; these genera were erected to account for differences in sexually dimorphic traits. However, the traits used to diagnose these genera have been thought to be insufficient.[2] There are currently 67 recognized species in this genus:[8] The genus is widely distributed on nearly the entire subcontinent, from Costa Rica to Argentina, on both slopes of the Andes.[11] Rineloricaria species are found in a large variety of habitats, including large rivers, streams, and lagoons, associated with bottoms consisting of sand or rocks, sometimes found in marginal vegetation. They are also found to tolerate environments with a wide temperature gradient.[6] Rineloricaria have an adaptive capacity enabling many species to exploit the most varied habitats; some species, such as R. strigilata, have been caught in highly polluted bodies of water and represent some of the main components of the ichthyological diversity in such habitats.[3] The average length of a Rineloricaria catfish is about 13\u00a0cm (5\u00a0in) long.[citation needed] The fish are long, slender, have no visible barbels, an erect dorsal fin, a very thin caudal peduncle, and a narrow face. The coloration of the fishes is usually light brown with darker blotches, and have a dark dorsal fin.[citation needed] They are also covered with bony plates and have a sucker disk mouth, as is common with most fish in the family Loricariidae. Sexual dimorphism includes hypertrophied development of the odontodes along the sides of the head, on the pectoral spines and rays, and predorsal area of mature males. Several species also show hypertrophied development of the odontodes on the entire caudal peduncle.[11] In males, the pectoral fin spine is often thick, short, and curved when compared to the female.[2] Rineloricaria are cavity brooders. Numerous eggs (often more than 100) are laid attached to one another in single layer masses on the cavity floor, and are brooded by males.[11] Rineloricaria exhibit high levels of karyotypic diversity with chromosome numbers ranging from 36 to 70.[11]"

        "description": " The genus Panaque contains a small number of small to medium-sized South American suckermouth armoured catfishes that are notable for being among the very few vertebrates that feed extensively on wood.[1]  In addition, algae and aufwuchs are an important part of the diet, and they use their rasping teeth to scrape this from rocks. These fish are also popular aquarium fish, where the sound of scraping as these fish forage for food is easily audible.[citation needed] Scobinancistrus and Panaqolus are sometimes considered to be subgenera of this genus.[2] There are currently seven recognized species in this genus:[3] The name Panaque is a Latinisation of a native Venezuelan name for these fish. It is pronounced \"pan ack\" in Britain and Europe, but often as \"pan aki\" or \"pan a kay\" in America. The Japanese call these fish \"pana koo ee\".[citation needed] Panaque are found in the Magdalena River, Orinoco River, Amazon River, Essequibo River, and Lake Maracaibo drainages.[5] All Panaque come from tropical South American and inhabit fast-flowing streams and rivers. They are weak swimmers but like other armoured catfish possess a strong sucker-like mouth with which they can hold on to submerged rocks and wood.[citation needed] Like other members of the armoured catfish family (Loricariidae), all Panaque have sturdy, armoured bodies covered in toughened plates of skin called scutes. These are not scales; like all catfish, Panaque lack scales. As well their armour, these catfish have very sturdy dorsal and pectoral fin spines. They use these defensively, either to wedge themselves into cracks from which predators cannot pull them, or else to prevent large predators from swallowing them. Another characteristic typical of the armoured catfish family is an iris. Most fish are unable to regulate the amount of light that enters the eye since they have irises that cannot change size. Both male and female Panaque develop bristles, known as odontodes, on the side of head immediately before and onto the pectoral fins.[citation needed] Unlike predatory catfish, these omnivorous catfish have very short barbels. These barbels can be seen in the photograph of mouth of a Panaque shown here; they are the short pointed structures on either side of a suckermouth. This sucker-like mouth allows them to attach to rocks and remain stationary with very little expenditure of energy.[citation needed] Along with the species of the Hypostomus cochliodon group (formerly the genus Cochliodon), it has been argued that Panaque are the only fish that can eat and digest wood.[5] Possible adaptations to consuming wood include spoon-shaped, scraper-like teeth and highly angled jaws to chisel wood.[5] Researchers have also identified symbiotic gut bacteria that may allow the fish to digest the wood they consume.[6] However, others have argued that Panaque do not in fact digest wood, and in fact take up very little energy from the wood they consume and actually lose weight when fed just wood.[7] Furthermore, their digestive tracts are no different from those of related catfish and they do not hold wood particles in the gut longer than other catfish, suggesting Panaque are not physically adapted to eating wood, and are in fact detritivores much like other Loricariidae.[7] In September 2010 scientists from the US National Science Foundation claimed to have discovered a new species of wood-eating catfish in the Alto Pur\u00fas National Park, Peru.[8] Several species of Panaque have become popular aquarium fish. The brightly coloured Panaque nigrolineatus is particularly popular and is known as the \"royal panaque\" or \"royal pleco\", monikers which reflect its comparative costliness and beauty over the common pleco. Royal plecos have a greyish-green base color against which thick, dark bluish-black stripes are set; their fins are edged with gold or cream, and their eyes are red. In captivity, royal plecos typically grow to around 30\u00a0centimeters in length.[9] A second species, Panaque cochliodon, is familiar to many aquarists as the \"blue-eyed pleco\". Though the blue-eyed pleco was widely traded in the late 1980s and early 1990s, it is now only rarely exported from its native Colombia.[10] It is also associated with the binomina Panaque suttonorum and P. suttoni, though Panaque suttonorum is a different fish which only comes from Venezuela. Blue-eyed plecos reach a similar size to royal plecos, but because many specimens are infected with a bacterium closely related to Rickettsia, mortality immediately after import can be high.[11] However, once they have settled in and begun feeding, they are no more difficult to keep than royal plecos.[citation needed] All Panaque catfish require much the same care in captivity. Panaque mainly demand a mixed diet including green algae, fresh vegetables such as carrots, courgettes, and spinach, but because they are argued to be xylophagous, many aquarists provide driftwood for them to graze upon, as well. The meaty foods enjoyed by other plecos are not required. Because they are relatively big for aquarium fish and produce an unusually large amount of waste, a high-capacity tank and filter are essential. Royal panaques tolerate a wider range of water chemistry than others\u2014they prefer somewhat soft, slightly acid water but they will tolerate hard, alkaline water.[citation needed] In terms of behavior, Panaque are peaceful and nocturnal bottom-dwellers which make good residents in community tanks. Like most of the other armored catfish, they are territorial, and groups should only be kept in very large tanks.[citation needed]"

        "description": " Pseudorinelepis genibarbis is a species of armored catfish native to Brazil, Peru, and Ecuador where it is found in the Amazon basin.[1] Pseudorinelepis is one of three genera contained in the tribe Rhinelepini, one of the tribes of Hypostominae.[2] Canthopomus and Monistiancistrus are synonyms of the genus Pseudorinelepis.[3] Previously, Pseudorinelepis was a genus of four species, but now the other three species are synonymous with P. genibarbis.[3] P. genibarbis is large and bulky and reaches a length of 35.6 centimetres (14.0\u00a0in) SL.[1] The armor plates along the side of the fish are thick, are keeled, and encase the whole body.[3] The adipose fin is not present.[3] Like other members of Rhinelepini, they do not have the omega iris that is typical in most species of Loricariids.[3] In Iquitos, Peru, it is known as carachama sin costilla, which actually means \"Loricariid without ribs\"; this refers to the trait that it shares with other Rhinelepini catfish that do not have ribs past the sixth vertebra.[3] This species is highly variable in coloration. P. genibarbis may be completely dark brown to black, mottled with tan to dark brown background and black streaks, or light tan with large, sparse spots located at base of lateral plates, fin membranes, and abdomen.[3] Males have longer odontodes on the cheek that are denser and more numerous than in females. It has been suggested that breeding males may also have orange on the cheeks and dorsal and caudal fin spines, although this may be restricted to fish from the Branco River.[3] P. genibarbis is found in small, sluggish streams, floodplain lakes, and large rivers.[3] Water quality measurements showed that the water tended to be low in oxygen, but neutral (pH\u00a07.0).[1] P. genibarbis is able to swallow air, like many other Loricariids. However, this species is not an obligate air-breather.[1] When disturbed, it is able to swallow air to become neutrally buoyant and swim in the water column.[1] This species is an armored catfish which, since the 1990s, has started to be offered quite regularly as an aquarium fish under the name \"Pineapple Pleco\".[citation needed] The term \"pleco\" here is of course a popular generalisation, as taxonomy has never placed this fish in the former genus Plecostomus. The armour is also pleasantly spiked along the sides of the fish, which causes the pineapple resemblance celebrated in the commercial name of the species. Additionally, under the L-number system used by hobbyists, it as referred to as both L152 and L095. There is quite a degree of colour variation, which is probably the main reason for the confusion over species. Some males having orange cheeks, which is why \"orange cheek Pleco\" is another common name found in circulation.[4] This is not made any easier by the fact that the fish will gradually darken if left in a tank with a darker substrate and lighten when kept on a lighter substrate. These changes take some time (hours or days) to effect, they do not happen quickly, so there is no real \"chameleon\" effect here, but no doubt it is a useful survival mechanism.[citation needed] From the viewpoint of the aquarist the fish is peaceful, sociable with others of its own type, non-territorial and omnivorous. Unsurprisingly, therefore, they do well in soft water, although pH values of up to 7.5 are acceptable, and the temperature range may fluctuate gently between 23-27\u00a0\u00b0C (73.4-80.6\u00a0\u00b0F.[4] Spawning in captivity has not yet been reliably reported.[4] Sexual dimorphism is slight, being determined mainly by a more rounded body shape in the females, and orange \"cheeks\", this refers to the operculum, in the males. The fish will, unlike most hypostomines, feed on flake from the water surface, turning upside-down to do so.[citation needed] It is also able to augment water-dissolved oxygen with atmospheric oxygen, but does not need to do so, having fully functional gills, so when this fish does gulp it is a useful warning that the aeration in the tank is low.[1]"

This species will grow to a maximum length of 43 centimetres (17\u00a0in) SL and reach a weight of 310 g.[1] It is sometimes confused with the Hypostomus plecostomus (another armored catfish known as the \"common plecostomus\").[2] The two species can be distinguished by their number of dorsal rays. P. pardalis has 11\u201313, while the H. plecostomus has only 5\u20138 dorsal rays. It is also commonly misindentified as P. disjunctivus and can be differentiated by its spotted patterning.[3] There is an albino color variation of this species, usually referred to as an \"Albino Plecostomus\".[4] The amelanistic form may also be sold as the \"chocolate pleco\".[5] The species is native to the Amazon River Basin of Brazil and Peru, preferring pH ranges of 7.0\u20137.5. It is a facultative air breather; although normally a bottom-dwelling fish, it has the ability to breathe air from the surface of the water during dry periods or when dissolved oxygen is too low. The Amazon sailfin catfish has been introduced to a number of countries outside its native range.[1] It is recorded in the Marikina River in the Philippines and known as the \"janitor fish\", where it has become a local pest and sold in bulk, in efforts to eliminate the fish.[6][7][8][9] In the United States, invasive populations of sailfin catfishes like the Amazon sailfin catfish have been observed to be ecologically detrimental, as they disrupt aquatic food chains, decrease the abundance of native aquatic species, and degrade aquatic plants or banks of waterbodies through burrowing and tunneling.[10]"

Hypostomus punctatus is a freshwater fish native to South America, in the coastal drainages of southeastern Brazil and Uruguay. It is one of a number of species commonly referred to as \"plecostomus\" or \"common pleco\" by aquarists. H. punctatus is a species of loricariid catfish. Like other members of this family, it possesses a suckermouth, armor plates, strong dorsal and pectoral fin spines, and the omega iris. This species reaches about 30 centimetres (12\u00a0in) TL.[1] Hypostomus punctatus is difficult to distinguish from closely related species, such as Hypostomus plecostomus. Identification is relatively difficult as there are many different similar species labelled as \"common pleco\". This species has a light brown coloration with a pattern of darker brown spots (its specific epithet, punctatus, means \"spotted\"). Because of this, the species may also be known as the spotted hypostomus. The species is not notably striped and is generally lighter in coloration than H. plecostomus.[2] H. punctatus is found in the wild in fast-flowing rivers as well as in flooded areas. It prefers water with a temperature of 22\u201328\u00a0\u00b0C, a pH range of 5\u20138, and a dH range of 0.5\u201325.[1] H. punctatus is primarily herbivorous and feeds on algae and detritus as well as plants and roots.[1]"

Although the name Hypostomus plecostomus is often used to refer to common plecostomus sold in aquarium shops, most are actually members of other genera.[3][1] Suckermouth catfish are of little or no value as a food fish, although they are at least occasionally consumed over their native range.[citation needed] A demand exists for them, however, as a bottom cleaner in the aquarium trade.[4] This species' native range is tropical northeastern South America; it naturally occurs in northeastern Brazil, the Guianas, and Trinidad and Tobago.[5] Confusingly, the name Hypostomus plecostomus (or Plecostomus plecostomus) has sometimes been incorrectly used for several more-or-less similar loricariid catfishes, both in the popular and scientific literature. For example, it has sometimes been suggested that it occurs in southern Central America, but this is an entirely separate species, Hemiancistrus aspidolepis (also known under another synonym, Hypostomus panamensis).[6][7] Some Loricariidae species have been widely introduced to several countries around the world and reported as H. plecostomus.[5] It is erroneous,[1] and the concerned species belong to the genus Pterygoplichthys (either P. pardalis,[8] P. disjunctivus,[9] P. anisitsi[10] or P. multiradiatus[11]). In the United States, a Pterygoplichthys species has been introduced to some regions in the South, most likely released by aquarists into the local waters. For example, they are present in a lake in the neighborhood of Hammock Trace Preserve in Melbourne, Florida. In Texas, reproducing populations occur in spring-influenced habitats of the San Antonio River (Bexar County), Comal Springs (Comal County), San Marcos River (Hays County), and San Felipe Creek (Val Verde County), as well as in drainage canals in the Rio Grande Valley and Houston.[12][13] The same identification issues have spread in the literature regarding the invasive catfishes in Taiwan, with H. plecostomus being one of the numerous names used to designate the species: DNA studies showed the alien fishes were actually P. pardalis and P. disjunctivus (that hybridise extensively).[14] H. plecostomus prefer to live in water between 72 and 86 degrees Fahrenheit (~22.2 to 30 degrees Celsius), with a pH between 6.5 and 7.5.[15] Hypostomus plecostomus is named for its sucker-like mouth, which allows it to adhere to a surface, as well as to hold and rasp at food, including newly hatched and baby golden apple snails as well as Malaysian trumpet snails.[16] This omnivorous species also feeds on algae, aquatic plants, and small crustaceans.[17][citation needed] Hypostomus plecostomus is one of many species of fish that is able to breathe air. Hypostomus plecostomus relies on its gills for respiration in normal and slightly hypoxic water, and the less oxygen present in the water, the more frequently it surfaces to breathe air.[18] The air is taken to the stomach where the oxygen is absorbed, and the air can be kept in the stomach to increase buoyancy, which may help it to feed on vegetation.[19] H. plecostomus is one of a number of species commonly referred to as \"plecostomus\" or \"common pleco\" by aquarists.  These fish are sold when they are young and small, but in the wild, they can grow to be a maximum size of 50 centimetres (20\u00a0in).[20] In captivity, however, a full-grown Hypostomus plecostomus only reaches 15 inches (38\u00a0cm) on average, which could be explained by the subpar oxygen levels in most home aquaria and other practices of bad fish husbandry.[21] In the aquarium trade, this dark-colored, bottom-feeding, nocturnal catfish is often purchased for its ability to clean algae from fish tanks but also contributes a lot of waste to the nitrogen cycle. They are difficult for other fish to harass, both due to the semi-aggressive nature of the fish as well as its thick armor.[22] In Bangladesh, the species, among some other suckermouth catfishes has become invasive. The government is currently on its way to impose a ban on the farming, hatchling production, breeding, marketing and trading of the fish.[23] It has also raised serious concern in India and Sri Lanka.[24] A large variety of common names is used to describe H. plecostomus, where plecostomus and the shortened \"pleco\" are interchangeable in all common names. The names include: The species' scientific name, Hypostomus plecostomus, is derived from the Latin hypo (meaning \"under\"), stoma (meaning \"mouth\"), and pleco (meaning \"pleated\").[citation needed] Many of the common names used to identify Hypostomus plecostomus are also used for other species, which augments the confusion surrounding H. plecostomus and other Loricariidae such as H. punctatus, Pterygoplichthys multiradiatus and P. pardalis. In 2012, Weber, Covain, and Fisch-Muller showed the type series of Carl Linnaeus was heterogenous and comprised two species: H. plecostomus (for which the authors designate a lectotype) and H. watwata.[1]"

        "description": " Pterygoplichthys gibbiceps[1]  is a species of armored catfish native to Brazil, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela where it is found in the Orinoco and Amazon basins. Pterygoplichthys gibbiceps shows all the characteristic features of its genus\u2014a large dorsal fin with more than nine rays, prominent nasal flares and a prominent hump or crest anterior to the dorsal fin as well as a substantial base to the dorsal fin. Adult fish easily attain a length of 50.0 centimetres (19.7\u00a0in) TL and can live for more than 20 years. A typical plec shape is shown, patternation consists of primarily irregular largish brown spots on a yellowish backgroung giving a honeycombed like appearance, additional pattern features common to related species may be visible on close inspection. As this fish grows the spots get smaller. Like most plecs this species is primarily herbivorous though will eat dead animals. In the wild these fish are found in shoals in sluggish rivers of the Amazon and Orinoco river systems, they also occupy flooded land during the wet season. During the dry season P. gibbiceps will aestivate in burrows around 1 metre long dug into mud banks along the length of a river, egg rearing is also presumed to take place in burrow. The species name comes from the Latin gibbus\u2014hump, and caput\u2014head, a reference to the centrally located ridge. Common names include 'gibbys', leopard sailfin catfish and clown plecs\u2014the juveniles have a comical appearance due to the large and obvious spots. Ancistrus gibbiceps and Glyptoperichthys gibbiceps are synonyms of P. gibbiceps.\nThe fish has recently been caught from river Ganges, Banaras and is suspected to be yet another entrant to Invasive exotic list of fish in India. This fish is extremely popular in the aquarium, due to its unusual appearance and its ability to eat algae; the bane of all aquarists. This and other related species are bred in ponds in tropical regions for the aquarium trade. In general P. gibbiceps is peaceful towards other fish though territorial disputes arise with other plecos and fish of a similar or larger size. Though not nocturnal they are more active at night and will spend daylight hours 'hiding' in a secluded location. As the fish grows big (up to 60.96\u00a0cm in the aquarium) a large tank with good filtration is required, in general these fish are tolerant to a wide range of freshwater conditions though prefer well aerated water. The fish will 'gulp' surface air in poorly oxygenated water. A lesser-known trait is its mild camouflage ability, where it can lighten or darken its scales in a tiger-stripe pattern. It may reflect its mood or comfortability with the water parameters.[2][3] Pterygoplichthys gibbiceps is an omnivore. They can be fed with vegetables such as nettles, lettuce, spinach or carrots. Their diet can include meat; such as earthworms, blood worms or chopped shrimps.  They will also eat prepared foods from a pet shop, especially sinking algae wafers. The best way to breed Pterygoplichthys gibbiceps is to feed them with wide spectrum of food. With a good diet, they will grow quickly (up to 30 centimetres in one year). Adult Pterygoplichthys gibbiceps  may eat many aquarium plants. It can be almost impossible to differentiate males from females. Males in a group can be determined as they may become more territorial. Reproduction involves females laying roes into caves or hollows of roots. There is a high rate of mortality until the spawn are five centimeters long. The reason for this is unknown."

        "description": " The zebra pleco (Hypancistrus zebra) is a species of catfish endemic to a small section of the Rio Xingu in Brazil. It occurs in the big bend area of the river, downstream from the town of Altamira, Para. It was first described in 1991.[3] It gets its name from its black and white stripes, resembling the colouration of a zebra. This species grows to a length of 6.4 centimetres (2.5\u00a0in) SL.[3] This species was exported from Brazil in 1987 for sale as aquarium fish. However, currently, the Brazilian government bans the export of certain fish species, including H. zebra. H. zebra is threatened by the Belo Monte Dam in the Xingu river which has caused a severe reduction of the water flow of the entire known distribution range of the species. Due to this, the species has been classified as critically endangered and may soon become extinct in the wild. It is subject to several captive breeding programs. It is commercially bred in captivity for the aquarium trade. Mature males have a wider head and longer interopercular spines than females. After spawning, the males will guard the eggs. The fry swim after seven days and absorb the yolk sac in two weeks.[4] The minimum tank size for the species is said to be a minimum of 30 gallons (approximately 115 liters).\u00a0Maintaining water parameters at certain levels is also of importance when keeping them in an aquarium. The ideal water temperature for their tank is about 79\u201388\u00a0\u00b0F (26\u201331\u00a0\u00b0C). Reasonable water acidity levels are 6.5 pH to 7.0 pH with the water hardness ranging between 2 and 6 dKH.[5] Hypancistrus zebra can be referred to using the L-numbering convention often applied to Loricariidae, although, unlike most loricariids, H. zebra has two associated L-numbers: L-046 and L-098 both refer to the species. H. zebra is a predator and requires a high protein diet, typically including small invertebrates such as insect larvae. When in captivity, the species is often fed fresh or frozen bloodworms, brine shrimp and algae wafers. Occasionally, the species may be fed vegetables such as lettuce, cucumber, and squash.[5] This species should not be kept in the typical community aquarium, or with discus, despite advice to the contrary. These catfish thrive in biotopes with small dither fish which do not compete with H. zebra for food. The tank should mimic their natural environment with a substrate of small smooth gravel and pebbles with smooth boulders, cobbles and rocks forming caves and crevices.[6] The water must be highly oxygenated with a strong flow and surface agitation. It is an expensive species because it can only be collected or reproduced in small numbers. It is a simple fish to keep but it needs clean, warm water and a fast-moving current. They are unlikely to survive in still water or a dirty environment.[4] It is nocturnal, moderately territorial, and prefers plenty of hiding places.[4] In 2004, the zebra pleco was added to the IBAMA list of endangered species and exporting it from Brazil was made illegal. However, this law is only present in Brazil and black market fish traders smuggle them out of Brazil to then sell in other countries (primarily Colombia). Similarly to other Hypancistrus species, the male will trap the female in a cave where she will lay her eggs for the male to fertilise. This is usually done at around a pH of 6.5-7.2 and a water temp of 27\u00b0. This process can take between 1 and 5 days depending on the experience the female has in motherhood. The male will often bite the female to keep her in the cave, which is a natural behaviour for the species. Once the eggs are fertilised, the female will leave, although the male will guard the eggs until they hatch and may even stay to see them develop into fry. Once born, the fry will have a yolk sack attached to their underbelly, which is typically gone in a few days.[7] The species is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that international trade (including in captive bred specimens) is regulated by the CITES permitting system.[2]"

It belongs to the armored catfish family (Loricariidae). Named for its sail-like dorsal fin, the part of its scientific name multiradiatus means \"many-rayed\" and refers to the rays of the dorsal fin. P. multiradiatus is one of a number of species commonly referred to as the common pleco by aquarists.[1] Other scientific names that were used (as synonyms) for P. multiradiatus include Hypostomus multiradiatus, Ancistrus multiradiatus, and Liposarcus multiradiatus. P. multiradiatus is sometimes confused with Pterygoplichthys pardalis, which is a different species of pleco. P. multiradiatus goes by a number of common names. It can be called the \"long-fin armored catfish\" in Hawaii, \"sailfin catfish\", \"sailfish catfish\", \"many-rayed (multiradiatus) pleco\" or \"radiated ptero\" in the United States, \u591a\u8f3b\u7ffc\u7532\u9bf0 in Mandarin Chinese.\nP. multiradiatus is mottled brown/black and inhabits freshwater streams and lakes and in weedy, mud-bottomed canals in its native habitat: the Orinoco River basin in Venezuela. Its geographic distribution is 10\u00b0N - 1\u00b0N, 68\u00b0W - 61\u00b0W. This tropical, nocturnal bottom-dweller likes warm water at the temperature range of 23\u201327\u00a0\u00b0C, pH range: 6.5\u20137.8, and dH range: 4\u201320. P. multiradiatus browses on substrate, mainly feeding on benthic algae and aquatic weeds, but will also take worms, insect larvae and other bottom-dwelling invertebrates as food. One of the large plecos (growing to a maximum of 50.0 centimetres (19.7\u00a0in) TL), this species likes solitude, is relatively peaceful as an aquarium fish and does well with cichlids and other big fish, and should be kept in large tanks only and with plenty of rocks and driftwood in which to hide. Like many other plecos, it is very important in the aquarium trade. P. multiradiatus has been introduced to Taiwan,[2] Puerto Rico,[3] Florida, Hawaii, Texas, India, and Mexico,[4] most likely as the result of escapes or releases from aquarium fish farms. This species is firmly established in these and other locations, where it is regarded as a harmful invasive species being relatively inedible to people and predators, causing damage to fishing gear, competing and harming against native species and disrupting environments by its burrowing activities.[4] In this context its relative, Hypostomus plecostomus, has also been similarly implicated though it seems likely that in Asia, both or related species are implicated."

The zebra oto was described in 2004 from a tributary of the R\u00edo Ucayali in Peru.[2] Its closest relatives appear to be O. huaorani, O. bororo, O. mariae, and O. mura, as well as the more recently described species O. batmani.[3] This fish is found in Peru in the Ucayali River and possibly Mara\u00f1\u00f3n River as well. These fish are found in mid-sized creeks with clear water. It may also be found in small ponds.[1] They associate with marginal vegetation.[2] The zebra oto has a general body-shape like other Otocinclus species. They are small, have a suckermouth, and have armor on their bodies. The zebra oto can be distinguished from all other members of this genus by its vertical stripe-like blotches and its complete lateral line. The zebra oto has the highest number of teeth of any species of Otocinclus. The W mark on its caudal fin distinguishes this fish from all others except for O. batmani. The zebra oto reaches about 4.4\u00a0cm (1.7\u00a0in) in SL, though the males are smaller.[2] The zebra oto is listed as endangered by the IUCN Red List due to its limited range and overexploitation for the aquarium trade. Additionally, it is not protected in any part of its range, nor is it listed on CITES. The species has a decreasing population trend in the wild.[1] The zebra oto has been for sale in the aquarium trade since the early 1990s. It has been popular since at least 2000.[2] They are an occasionally seen species, and are bred in Asia in good numbers.[4]"

        "description": " Panaqolus maccus, commonly called the clown panaque, clown plecostomus, clown pleco, or ringlet pleco, is a dwarf loricariid. By numbering systems such as the L-number system, this fish may also be known as L104, L162, or LDA22.[1] This fish is endemic to Venezuela where it is found in the tannic Apur\u00e9 and Caron\u00ed River basins.[2] Their natural environment is driftwood tangles near riverbanks.[1] This species is a small loricariid. It reaches a length of 8.8 centimetres (3.5\u00a0in) SL.[2] This species has a striped pattern. However, this colouration may change with age. There are specimens with straight bars, but there are also specimens with a broken or wavy pattern. The wavy pattern form is found in the actual Orinoco and its tributaries in Bolivar State, Venezuela, while the \"normal\" patterned P. maccus comes from further north and west (Cojedes, Portuguesa, Guarico, and Apure States) in the Llanos where the drainages run into the Apure River.[1] Panaqolus maccus is one of the most common species of small, striped loricariids available in the fishkeeping hobby. This species adapts well to aquarium life.[1] They are not too difficult to spawn.[1] It should always be provided with enough driftwood in the tank, as it is a wood-eating fish. However fresh vegetables, spirulina and frozen foods such as bloodworms are recommended to be given as well from time to time. They are very peaceful fish suited for the average community tank. They are a hardy species of catfish and can tolerate various water parameters but prefer softer, more acidic water. Good filtration is needed because of the large amounts of waste they produce, caused by their wood-based diet. It is suited for tanks starting from 15 gallons.[1] It is difficult to successfully breed these fish in captivity. The tank setting and water parameters must be as near to their native habitat as possible. Seasonal changes can be simulated by adjusting the pH and temperature of the water. Soft driftwoods and cave formations give ample hiding places for the females to feel comfortable, and they may deposit eggs at some point.[3]"

        "description": " The emerald catfish  (Corydoras splendens) is a tropical freshwater fish belonging to the Corydoradinae sub-family of the family Callichthyidae native to the Amazon Basin in South America.[1] It has traditionally been known as Brochis splendens.[2] The fish has appeared on a stamp in Brazil.[3] It was originally described as Callichthys splendens by Fran\u00e7ois Louis de la Porte, comte de Castelnau in 1855.  This species was once also commonly called Brochis coeruleus. W. A. Gosline was the first to suspect that the two species were the same in 1940, but it was actually Njiseen & Isbr\u00fccker, in 1970, who combined the two, giving sufficient reasons for doing so. The species would be described as Brochis splendens, until most of the catfish formerly classified as Brochis were re-classified into Corydoras.[2] The current recognized classification is thus Corydoras splendens.[1] It is native to the upper reaches Amazon Basin.[1] This includes Ucayali River to Pucallpa, Ambiyacu River, and the area around Iquitos in western Brazil, southeastern Colombia, eastern Ecuador and eastern Peru. Depending upon the angle of lighting, the fish's body reflects a metallic green, blue-green, or even a bluish color.  The ventral area is yellowish with the pectoral, ventral, and anal fins yellowish and the dorsal, caudal, and adipose fins a translucent brownish.  The females are larger and more robust than the males, and have a more pinkish belly as opposed to the more yellowish one for the males. This fish can be distinguished from the green/bronze corydoras catfish by its usually larger size, stouter body, and more pointed snout. The fish inhabits sluggish waters with dense vegetation along the banks.[1] It occurs in shallow muddy waters and will grow in length up to 7.5\u00a0centimetres (3\u00a0in).[1] It lives in a tropical climate in water with a 5.8\u20138.0 pH, a water hardness of 2\u201330 dGH, and a temperature range of 22\u201328\u00a0\u00b0C (72\u201382\u00a0\u00b0F).[1] It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, and insect larvae. It lays eggs in dense vegetation and adults do not guard the eggs. The emerald catfish is a common species in freshwater aquaria.  It is a peaceful, undemanding species and can be maintained under the same conditions as most Corydoras species.  They are shy and easily frightened when kept as individuals, so it is best kept in small groups of at least three, with more being recommended.  The tank should have only a soft, fine bottom to prevent damage to barbels and should be heavily planted.[4] Feeding is not difficult and they accept almost anything, although live worms are especially appreciated.[5] It does well in a community tank and does not tear up the plants.[5] Spawning has been achieved in captivity.[4] Typically, the fish are separated into a breeding tank in the ratio of three males to two females, all well-conditioned on live foods.  The couple will spawn while sitting on the bottom, not while swimming as many similar species do. In captivity, the female collects the eggs in her pelvic fin basket and pastes them individually to plants and other objects.  Eggs will be deposited by the female throughout the tank, but especially on any floating surface plants.  According to most reports, the parents do not immediately try to eat the eggs.  The eggs hatch in about four days and the fry become free swimming two days later."

It originates in coastal drainages in South America from Rio de Janeiro to Santa Catarina, Brazil.[2] It was originally described as Callichthys barbatus by Jean Ren\u00e9 Constant Quoy & Joseph Paul Gaimard in 1824, from which it was transferred to genus Corydoras as Corydoras barbatus, a name which by which it is still being referred to in the aquarium industry. The species was further transferred to genus Scleromystax in 2003.[3] The fish will grow in length up to 9.8\u00a0centimetres (3.9\u00a0in).[2] This species has pronounced sexual dimorphism. The dorsal and pectoral fins of males reach, or almost reach, the caudal peduncle, and well-developed odontodes are inserted in fleshy tissue on a large area on the sides of the snout in fully grown males.[4] The banded corydoras lives in a subtropical climate in water with a 6.0\u20138.0 pH, a water hardness of 2\u201325 dGH, and a temperature of 68\u00a0\u00b0F (20\u00a0\u00b0C) to 82\u00a0\u00b0F (28\u00a0\u00b0C).[2] It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. It lays eggs in dense vegetation and adults do not guard the eggs. In captivity, as the sperm are released the female sinks to the bottom, resting on one of her pectoral fins while she starts fanning with the other pectoral fin. At this time, some eggs are released which fall into the pelvic fin basket and are apparently fertilized at that time. The banded corydoras is of commercial importance in the aquarium trade industry. Though peaceful, they get larger than most Corydoras and are therefore less suitable for small aquaria.[5]  This Callichthyidae-related article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it."

It originates in inland waters in South America, and is found in the Yuruar\u00ed River in Venezuela and the Corantijn and Rupununi River basins in Guyana and Suriname.  In the system of \"C-Numbers\" developed by the German fishkeeping magazine DATZ to identify undescribed species of Corydoras in the aquarium hobby, this fish had been assigned number \"C31\" until it was correctly identified. The fish will grow in length up to 1.9 inches (4.7 centimeters).  It lives in a tropical climate in water with a 6.0 \u2013 8.0 pH, a water hardness of 2 \u2013 25 dGH, and a temperature range of 72 \u2013 79\u00a0\u00b0F (22 \u2013 26\u00a0\u00b0C).  It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter.  It lays eggs in dense vegetation and adults do not guard the eggs.  The female holds 2\u20134 eggs between her pelvic fins, where the male fertilizes them for about 30 seconds.  Only then does the female swim to a suitable spot, where she attaches the very sticky eggs. The pair repeats this process until about 100 eggs have been fertilized and attached. The blackstripe corydoras is of commercial importance in the aquarium trade industry."

        "description": " The bronze corydoras  (Corydoras aeneus), also known as the green corydoras, bronze catfish, lightspot corydoras or wavy catfish, is a species of freshwater fish in the armored catfish family, Callichthyidae, often kept as an aquarium fish. It is widely distributed in South America on the eastern side of the Andes, from Colombia and Trinidad to the R\u00edo de la Plata basin;[2] however, as presently defined it is a species complex and a taxonomic review is necessary.[3] It was originally described as Hoplosoma aeneum (based on a specimen from Trinidad) by Theodore Gill in 1858 and has historically also been referred to as Callichthys aeneus.[2] The adult size is 6\u00bd cm for males and a slightly larger 7\u00a0cm for females (2\u00bd to 2\u00be inches).[4]   Females have a slightly higher body frame than males in accordance with their larger abdominal region. Their average life span is 10 years. It has a yellow or pink body, white belly, and is blue-grey over its head and back. Its fins are yellow or pink and immaculate. In common with most Corydoras the dorsal, pectoral and adipose fins have an additional sharp barb and have a mild poison which causes fish which try to attack them to get stung. A brownish-orange patch is usually present on the head, just before the dorsal fin, and is its most distinctive feature when viewed from above in the stream. Their upper sides are often a greenish color, which is the reason another common name for this fish is the green corydoras. Like many other catfishes, females are larger than males in this species.[5] They are found in quiet, shallow waters with soft bottoms that can sometimes be heavily polluted by clouds of disturbed mud from the bottom, but it also inhabits running waters.[2] In its native habitat, it inhabits waters with a temperature range of 25\u00a0\u00b0C to 28\u00a0\u00b0C (77\u00a0\u00b0F to 82\u00a0\u00b0F), pH 6.0\u20138.0, and hardness 5 to 19 DGH.[2] Like most members of the genus Corydoras, these catfish have a unique method of coping with the low oxygen content that prevails in such environments. In addition to utilizing their gills like any other fish, they rapidly come to the surface of the water and draw air in through their mouth. This air is then absorbed through the wall of the intestine and any surplus air is expelled through the vent.[2] It typically stays in schools of 20 to 30 individuals.[2] It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter.[2] Reproduction occurs with the onset of the rainy season, which changes the water chemistry.[2] Females spawn 10\u201320 egg-clutches with multiple males at a time, but an entire egg clutch is inseminated by the sperm of a single male.[5] In laboratory observations, it was found that bronze corydoras have a unique method of insemination. When these fish reproduce, the male will present his abdomen to the female. The female will attach her mouth to the male's genital opening, creating the well-known \"T-position\" many Corydoras exhibit during courtship. The female will then drink the sperm. The sperm rapidly moves through her intestines and is discharged together with her eggs into a pouch formed by her pelvic fins. The female can then swim away and deposit the pouch somewhere else alone. Because the T-position is exhibited in other species than just C. aeneus, it is likely that they also exhibit this behavior.[6] In the wild, eggs are laid on waterweeds.[5] Males do not form territories or compete over females; interference between males might only happen when two males present their abdomens simultaneously. On the other hand, females do not choose between males. Mating is more or less random; therefore, male reproductive success is directly related to courtship frequency.[5] The eggs of C. aeneus exhibit a unique surface pattern with small villi-like protuberances which resemble attaching-filaments of teleost eggs. These structures allow the eggs to be adhesive and stick to a specific place or to each other. The presence of these structures may be related to the turbid habitat in which this species lives.[7] Bronze corydoras are probably the most popular Corydoras species.[8] It is annually bred and shipped in large quantities all over the world[9] It is easily bred and is produced in commercial quantities in the United States, Europe, and Singapore. Most of the available fish are therefore domestic strains. Wild imports are reported to be less easy to breed.[citation needed] They are a hardy and useful aquarium fish despite having a coloration that is by no means striking or unusual. Many aquarists are fascinated by the habits of these fish. They ceaselessly comb the bottom of the aquarium for food and therefore disturb it slightly, sending up detritus and waste material that has settled loosely on the bottom. They prefer being kept in groups of 5 or more, being sociable fish and are ideal fish for a community tank.[2] Other Corydoras species can be placed in the same aquarium, and despite the strong resemblance many species bear to one another, the species will tend to separate out and only move about among their own kind. Corydoras aeneus is not particular about the composition of the water. Adequate conditions are a temperature range of 20 to 28\u00a0\u00b0C (68 to 82\u00a0\u00b0F), pH of 6.0\u20138.0, and hardness of 2\u201330 DGH. The water should have no salt added to it.[8] A fairly dense growth of plants with a number of possible hiding places is greatly appreciated. Corys are easy to feed, they are omnivores eating all flake and pelleted food and also live and frozen foods. When it comes to sperm, then the female glues the eggs, only a few in number, to the chosen substrate and then (sometimes) quickly touches them with her mouth. After several acts of spawning, which span a total of two to three hours, one female will have produced up to 200 eggs. Frequently, two males are used for each female, as one male has difficulty fertilizing all the eggs. The eggs gradually grow darker in color, and just prior to hatching (ranging from three days at 28\u00a0\u00b0C to a week at 20\u00a0\u00b0C) they turn dark brown. The fry keep to the bottom of the tank, feeding on detritus and any fine foods available. The parents may spawn again within two to three weeks. The albino corydoras is an albino variety of the bronze corydoras that has been developed for the aquarium trade, with a pale pink or orange body and red eyes.  It is physically similar to normally-colored individuals, although some breeders report that the fry are a little slower to develop.[10] Others say that the albinos are practically blind and that the males are somewhat sterile, although this may be due to extensive inbreeding.[11] Albino bronze corydoras are frequently injected with bright dye (via a needle) and sold in aquariums. This controversial practice is known as \"painting\" or \"juicing\" fish."

It lays eggs in dense vegetation, and adults do not guard the eggs. Unlike most Corydoras species but similar to the other \"saddlenoses\", C. narcissus tend to occur in small groups (not larger groups) and especially during the breeding period mature males are quite aggressive towards each other.[3][7] The species was first collected by Herbert R. Axelrod and Martin R. Brittan. It was first described and named narcissus by Han Nijssen and Isa\u00e4c J. H. Isbr\u00fccker to recognize the collectors \"for their many naming suggestions\".[8]"

        "description": " The dwarf corydoras (Corydoras hastatus), dwarf catfish, tail spot pygmy catfish, or micro catfish is a tropical freshwater fish belonging to the subfamily Corydoradinae of the family Callichthyidae.  It originates in inland waters in South America, and is found in the Amazon River and Paraguay River basins in Argentina, Bolivia, and Brazil.[1] The specific epithet hastatus means with a spear, in reference to the spearhead-like spot on the tail root. The body of Corydoras hastatus is typically more elongated than other Corydoras species.  Its body is a translucent white to olive color, with a thin dark stripe on the sides from behind the gill cover to the root of the tail, and a whitish belly.  It has a white crescent at the base of the tail surrounding a black spot.  The fish will grow in length up to 1.4 inches (3.5\u00a0cm), but 1.0 inch (2.5\u00a0cm) is more typical.  Males are smaller, more slender and have a more pointed dorsal fin than females. The dwarf corydoras lives in a (sub)tropical climate in water with a 6.0\u20138.0 pH, a water hardness of 5\u201319 dGH, and a temperature range of 68\u201382 F (20\u201328\u00a0\u00b0C).[1] It is found in ponds.[1] It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. They are found in the Paraguay River and Amazon River basins. C. hastatus lives among plants.[1] It is a schooling species.[1] It differs from most Corydoras species by preferring the midwater areas instead of the bottom, spending most of its time well off the bottom in areas of dense plants.  When it rests, it rests on the leaves of the plants.  Other Corydoras species with similar mid-water habits include C. habrosus and C. pygmaeus. The dwarf Corydoras maintains its position in a current by using rapid fin movements, especially with its pectoral fins. These rapid movements, combined with a high breathing rate, give the fish the appearance of being very \"nervous\" when compared with other fish. C. hastatus may even shoal with small characins. The fish lays its eggs in dense vegetation and the adults do not guard the eggs.  The female holds a single egg between her pelvic fins, where the male fertilizes them for about 30 seconds.  Only then does the female swim to a suitable spot, where she attaches the sticky egg. The pair repeats this process about every three minutes for from one to two hours with some 10- to 15-minute rests between egg releases.  Around 7 to 15 eggs are spawned in a single day, and spawning occurs on three to four consecutive days. A total of 30 to 60 eggs may be spawned by a single female over this period of time. The eggs hatch in three to nine days.  The fry are about 6\u00a0mm long at hatching, mostly translucent but sometimes with spots. In two months, the fry average about 18\u00a0mm in length.  The fry mature in six to eight months. The dwarf corydoras is of commercial importance in the aquarium trade industry.   Due to its small size, this fish can be kept in a relatively small aquarium; a 5-gallon (20 litre) tank is sufficient for a small school.  Since it is a schooling fish, it should only be kept in groups of at least six individuals.  It is a good community tank fish when kept with peaceful tankmates such as tetras, rasboras, and danios, but should not be kept with overly aggressive tankmates.  They have also been used as scavengers for fry tanks. The aquarium should be clean, well-aerated, and densely planted to provide hiding places.  A moderate current provided by a power filter or canister filter is appreciated.  The water should be slightly alkaline (pH about 7.6) within a temperature range of 24\u00b0 to 29\u00a0\u00b0C.  Although the fish is generally a mid-water dweller, a fine gravel or sand substrate should be provided since it will occasionally burrow. The fish will feed both in midwater or on a substrate, whether that substrate is a plant leaf, a broad rock, or the bottom of the tank.  It accepts most foods, including freeze-dried, flake, and frozen foods, although live foods are particularly appreciated. The methods of spawning this fish in the aquarium is similar to spawning most other Corydoras species.  The spawning tank can be as small as 2.5 gallons (10 L), but at least a 5-gallon (20 L) tank is recommended with aged water, a sponge filter and some plants.  Fish should be conditioned with large amounts of live foods such as Tubifex and whiteworms, during which time the females will become noticeably plumper.  Since C. hastatus may spawn as a school, the whole group can be conditioned for spawning at the same time, and for best results, there should be at least two males for every female. Spawning of well-conditioned fish may be initiated by the addition of cooler water.  During spawning, very little food is accepted, but the fish will immediately search for food after finishing.  It will typically attach its eggs to the plants in the aquarium, but if not enough plants are available, the sides of the aquarium may be used.  When the fry hatch, they can be fed newly hatched brine shrimp or microworms.  The parents may be ready to spawn again in a couple of weeks."

The body has other gray and black markings on an olive background. Compared with other species of Corydoras, the body is not as tall in comparison to its length, and its eyes are set a bit lower. The fish will grow in length up to 5.1 centimetres (2.0 inches). It lives in a tropical climate in water with a 6.0 - 8.0 pH, a water hardness of 2 \u2013 25 dGH, and a temperature range of 22\u201326\u00a0\u00b0C (72\u201379\u00a0\u00b0F). It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. Though it lays eggs in dense vegetation, adults do not guard them. In captivity, the male is reportedly territorial during the prespawning activities while the female is usually hidden among the plant roots. Both sexes clean the underside of plant leaves. Eggs are fastened under the leaves and are also attached to roots of plants. The elegant corydoras is of commercial importance in the aquarium trade industry. It tends to swim in the upper levels of the aquarium, instead of at the bottom as is common with most species of Corydoras, and does not seem to disturb the sediment as much."

        "description": " Corydoras panda is a species of catfish belonging to the genus Corydoras, of the family Callichthyidae, and is a native member of the riverine fauna of South America.  It is found in Peru and Ecuador, most notably in the Hu\u00e1nuco region, where it inhabits the R\u00edo Aquas, the R\u00edo Amarillae, a tributary of the R\u00edo Pachitea, and the R\u00edo Ucayali river system. The species was first collected by Randolph H. Richards in 1968, and was named Corydoras panda by Nijssen and Isbr\u00fccker in 1971. The specific name is an allusion to the appearance of the fish, which possesses large black patches surrounding the eyes, reminiscent of those found on the giant panda. Accordingly, the common names for this fish, which is a popular aquarium species, are panda corydoras and panda catfish. Corydoras panda has an off-white to pinkish-orange ground colour, and when observed under certain lighting conditions, a faint greenish iridescence is present upon the flanks and the operculum. The fins of the fish match the body in ground colour, upon close inspection being seen to be hyaline or translucent with coloured fin rays, with the dorsal fin being marked by a conspicuous black blotch that covers almost the entire fin area. The caudal peduncle is marked with a black band, this black band encircling the caudal peduncle from dorsal to ventral surface. The adipose fin, supported by a small fin spine, sometimes contains black pigmentation. The head is the same ground colour as the body, with a black mask surrounding the eyes, descending vertically from the fontanel, over each eye, and ending in a triangular wedge immediately before the ventral surface of the head. The pectoral fins are positioned immediately behind the operculum, and are usually oriented horizontally when the fish is at rest, extended in a manner similar to the wings of an aeroplane. The pelvic fins are positioned upon the ventral surface of the fish, located some way behind the pectoral fins. The first ray of the dorsal fin emanates from the body at approximately its point of greatest elevation, and a vertical line drawn downwards from this point meets the attachment point of the pelvic fins. The anal fin is located far to the rear of the ventral surface of the body, the attachment point of the first fin ray being somewhat forward of the black caudal peduncle marking described above. In common with all other members of the family Callichthyidae, the body surface is covered, not with scales, but with bony plates known as scutes. The lines of demarcation between individual scutes can be seen upon close examination of this and almost all other Callichthyid fishes, and in the case of some specimens of this species, are highlighted by additional black pigment. The fish possesses, in common with almost all Corydoras species, three pairs of barbels\u2014one pair of maxillary barbels and two pairs of rictal barbels. A fully mature adult specimen of this species attains a standard length of 55 millimetres (2.1\u00a0inches): this is the length attained by mature females, which grow larger than mature males, and also possess more rounded body outlines. Corydoras panda inhabits clear river waters that are relatively fast-flowing, well-oxygenated, and flowing over substrates that may comprise soft sand or fine gravel. These rivers are usually well vegetated with assorted species of aquatic plants. The proximity of the home rivers of the fish to the Andes mountain range, and the replenishment of those rivers with meltwaters from Andean snows at higher altitudes, has led the fish to be adaptable to cooler temperatures than the norm for 'tropical' fishes\u2014the temperature range of the fish is 16\u00a0\u00b0C to 28\u00a0\u00b0C, though the fish exhibits a marked preference for the cooler regions of this temperature spectrum, particularly in captivity. Indeed, the fish can, for small time-periods, survive temperatures as low as 12\u00a0\u00b0C, though captive rearing at such low temperatures is ill-advised. The native waters of Corydoras panda are consequently mineral-deficient, with a neutral to slightly acid pH, and replication of such conditions in captivity are recommended for successful maintenance. Corydoras panda has a preference for cooler than normal waters when compared to many other popular tropical fish species. Because of this, those who keep C. panda in community aquarium setting must choose tankmates that share its preference for cooler temperatures of around 20\u00a0\u00b0C (68\u00a0\u00b0F) to 25\u00a0\u00b0C (77\u00a0\u00b0F).[2] Given the cleanliness of the fish's native waters, scrupulous attention to water quality in the aquarium is considerably more important for this fish than for the more domesticated Corydoras species such as C. paleatus or C. aeneus. Additionally, scrupulous attention to aquarium substrate cleanliness is a must, as the fish are intolerant of poor aquarium maintenance in this area, and succumb to stress and disease rapidly if their aquaria are not kept to a high standard. Despite this, the species remains highly popular with aquarists, upon account of the appearance of the fish, and its lively, vivacious behaviour in a well-planned aquarium setting. Like many other Corydoras species, the panda catfish is a highly gregarious fish, and in common with several other smaller Corydoras species such as C. habrosus and C. pygmaeus, manifests a distinct need for numerous companions of its own species in order to thrive, and can thus be described as being more avowedly social than some of the larger members of the genus. A minimum of eight individuals should be housed in the same aquarium, and if space permits, this number should be revised upwards, as the fish exhibits a very definite preference for grouping together with others of its species. They also associate themselves easily with the clown loach and school together in currents where sufficient numbers of their own species is lacking. An aquarium for this species should be well furnished, ideally with a mixture of live aquatic plants, and solid furnishings providing caves, sheltered areas and hiding places to give the fish security. Floating plants to provide additional areas of shade are also welcomed by the fish. Like all Corydoras species, the fish feeds primarily upon animal matter. The aquarist is advised, however, that the traditional use of Corydoras catfishes as putative 'scavengers' in an aquarium setting will be detrimental to the well-being of this species\u2014it requires high quality foods for long-term maintenance, and a varied diet. Ideally, the fish should be given live foods at least intermittently, and will dine enthusiastically upon such items as Bloodworms (larvae of Chironomus midges), Daphnia, cultivated Brine Shrimp (Atermia salina), and Tubifex worms. The last, however, should be cultivated in order to minimise the risk of introducing pathogenic organisms to the aquarium, as Tubifex live in unsanitary conditions in the wild. Freeze dried Tubifex may be preferable, as the risk of introduction of disease is eliminated. High quality flake foods are also appreciated, particularly those containing shrimp or other similar matter. The lifespan of Corydoras panda in the aquarium has not been systematically determined, but given the longevity of other Corydoras species in the aquarium, it is reasonable to assume that well-cared for specimens will enjoy a lifespan in excess of ten years, and frequently in excess of 15 years. Corydoras panda follows, with a few minor deviations, the standard model for breeding for the genus. Stimulus for breeding consists of the influx of cooler, oxygenated waters into their habitat, usually corresponding in the wild with the onset of the rainy season. However, while some Corydoras species require a temperature drop in the aquarium for spawning to be stimulated, in the case of Corydoras panda, the temperature drop appears to matter much less, as specimens have spawned in the aquarium without a temperature drop. The addition of new, clean, oxygenated water appears to be the primary stimulus for this species. In the wild, the appearance of new water courtesy of the rains is followed by an increase in the populations of assorted food organisms, and feeding upon these conditions the fishes for breeding. Once conditioned fish are stimulated into spawning, males begin chasing females energetically. Females begin developing eggs within their reproductive tracts, and when 'ripe' (laden with eggs), become receptive to the attentions of the males. Eventually, one male will succeed in courting a female, using his barbels to provide stimulation to the female, usually beginning with caresses of the female's caudal peduncle, followed by caresses of the fontanel and the front of the head. if the female is receptive, then the male positions himself before the female, so that the female's mouth is in close proximity with one of the male's pectoral fins. The male then clasps the female's barbels between the pectoral fin and the body, and this stimulates the female to press against the male's side. When seen from above, the fish form a 'T' shape when conjoined thus, hence the term 'T position' has become conventional in aquarium circles when describing the breeding of Corydoras catfishes. Once the male and female are in the 'T position', the pressing of the female against the male's body stimulates his release of sperm. Though the exact mechanism of fertilisation has yet to be scientifically documented, from the observations of aquarists who have been successful in breeding Corydoras catfishes, it seems likely that the female takes the male's sperm through her mouthparts, and directs them through the gills, in a current that carries the sperm to her pelvic fins. At this point, the female releases a single egg (occasionally two), and purses her pelvic fins in order to provide a receptacle for the freshly extruded egg, which is then fertilised. One difference observed between the adoption of the 'T position' in Corydoras panda, when compared to other Corydoras species, is that the exercise is frequently more acrobatic in appearance, with the 'T position' being adopted in mid-water, some distance above the substrate, rather than resting upon the substrate as is the case with the majority of other Corydoras. Once the female is carrying a fertilised egg within her pelvic fins, she then seeks an egg deposition site. The choice of such a site is frequently, though not always, a mass of fine leaved aquatic vegetation. In the aquarium, the plant known as Java moss, Vesicularia dubayana, is of considerable utility as an egg repository for Corydoras catfishes, even though the plant is not a South American native, and panda catfish females will choose large clumps of this plant readily as safe deposition sites for fertilised eggs. The female is frequently pursued by one or more males as she seeks the deposition site, each male presumably seeking to be the chosen mate to fertilise the next egg. Up to 25 eggs may be produced by a single female during a single spawning, which may take place over four to five hours. Fertile Corydoras panda eggs require approximately 3\u20134 days development time before hatching, if kept at a temperature of 22\u00a0\u00b0C. This development time will vary with temperature, taking longer in cooler water. Upon hatching, the fry are four millimetres long, translucent, but already possessing the basic ground colour of the species, and upon close examination, possess fully formed barbels. Even newly hatched fry possess at least some hint of the adult eye patches, and as the fry grow, these patches darken and become more prominent. Even so, at just four millimetres in length, the fry are practically invisible against typical aquarium gravel unless seen to move. The fry take approximately four weeks to develop to the point where the finfold, a continuous undifferentiated membrane resembling that seen at the posterior of a tadpole, has differentiated into the unpaired fins (dorsal, anal and caudal fins). During this time, size will have increased to approximately eight or nine millimetres, and the fish will begin to develop colour changes leading to that of the adult fish. From this point, the caudal peduncle patch and dorsal fin patch will begin to appear, but the body will also be seen to be covered in fine black 'pepper dots' between these black patches. Only after a period of 10 to 12 weeks, at which point the fish has assumed a size of 12 to 14 millimetres, will the fish attain the colouration of the adult, and be in all respects a perfect miniature of the parents. Fry of this species are particularly sensitive to changes in water chemistry and to elevated temperatures. While adult fishes can withstand temperatures of 28\u00a0\u00b0C, fry will die of heat stress if exposed to temperatures above 26\u00a0\u00b0C, and their chances of survival are enhanced if the water temperature is kept at 22\u00a0\u00b0C or below. Water changes made to a nursery aquarium during the first 21 days of life of the fry\u2014the critical period during which they manifest the greatest sensitivity to their environment\u2014must be gradual, and the incoming water conditioned to match that of the existing aquarium water where possible before the water change takes place. While the fry are likely to develop best if given infusoria as part of their feeding r\u00e9gime, it is possible to raise fry to adulthood entirely upon prepared foods."

        "description": " Corydoras paleatus is a species of catfish (order Siluriformes) of the family Callichthyidae. Its common names include blue leopard corydoras, mottled corydoras, and peppered catfish.[1] It originates from the lower Paran\u00e1 River basin and coastal rivers in Uruguay and Brazil.[1] This fish species reach about 5.9 - 7 centimeters (2.3 - 2.75 \u00a0in) SL.[1] The male is smaller than the female, and in proportion to body length, the dorsal fin and pectoral fins are longer on the male than the female.[2] Corydoras paleatus is found in the Amazon basin,[1] and feeds on worms, crustaceans, insects, and plant matter.[1] C. paleatus has been known to produce sound; it does this by the abduction of its pectoral fins. This is used by males during courtship and intrapersonal communication, and by both sexes and juveniles when distressed.[2] In reproduction, males do not behave aggressively toward each other, nor do they monopolize mating areas or females.[2] The T-position is involved in courtship, as with many other Corydoras species.[2] Charles Darwin discovered the C. paleatus when he went to Buenos Aires during his expedition aboard the Beagle during the 1830s.[3] It is a very good choice for the community aquarium, as it is a hardy,[4] good-looking, and peaceful fish.[4] They can be successfully kept with other small, peaceful aquarium fish like livebearers, danios, and tetras. It is sometimes seen in the shops as an albino form, although this is similar to other albino corys (see the C. aeneus albino form). It grows to around 7.5\u00a0cm and is easily bred at home. These fish prefer a planted tank with temperatures around 16 to 24 \u00b0C (61 \u2013 75 \u00b0F), although they can take lower temperatures than this as it originates from colder waters.[3] Their high temperature tolerance seems poor, and 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F) is the highest safe temperature. They like to nibble on the algae that grow on floating plants but are not specialized algae-eating catfish. The lighting must not be too bright, and hiding places, such as bogwood, are needed as they like to hide from the light during certain parts of the day. Heavily planted areas should also be provided, where the light is minimized, as they like darker areas due to their bottom-feeding nature. Diet should be sinking pellets, algae wafers, frozen and live food, such as bloodworm or daphnia. They may also occasionally enjoy blanched spinach, which can be attached to plants with a peg or the side of the glass with magnetic clips. They can be seen to dart to the top of the tank: this is because they can use atmospheric oxygen to supplement what their gills extract from the water.[5] They will do this more frequently  when water quality is starting to deteriorate, and so should be watched for this indication. Peppered corydoras reach their sexual maturity and start to show reproductive behaviors once the females reach an average (minimum) size of 5.625 cm (2.214 inches) and once the males reach about 4.875 cm (1.919 inches).[citation needed] The males initiate the courtship ritual, which entails chasing the females around the tank. The female darts away, and the males search for her and find her a few moments later. The males shiver all over the female and may lie down on top of her. When she is ready to spawn, she turns to the male next to her and pounds below his ventral fin. The pair go into the \"T-position\" with the male releasing the sperm into the female's mouth before the sperm fertilizes the eggs[citation needed]. The female cups her ventral fins and lays a few eggs (usually between 4 and 12 eggs[citation needed]) in her fins.  The eggs are about 1.8 mm in diameter[citation needed]. The female now starts cleaning a spot on the glass to put her eggs on. Corydoras are egg depositors and lay their eggs all over the aquarium. Favorite spots include the heater, filters, and the glass, although, occasionally eggs are also laid on plants and driftwood. After depositing a group of eggs closely together, the female rests for a few moments. The males regroup and start chasing each other and then resume chasing the female. The males are so relentless in this pursuit that they try to mate with the female even while she is busy laying her eggs. The spawning lasts more than an hour, and many eggs are laid in different places. On average, about 50 to 150 eggs are laid during a single spawning[citation needed]. The incubation period for the eggs for peppered corydoras was found to be between 96 hours and 113 hours at 24\u00b12\u00b0C, with the average incubation period being about 102 hours (or 4.25 days)[citation needed]. In one study, the average hatching ratio of the eggs was found to be approximately 87%, with the overall egg-laying period lasting between 20 and 35 days[citation needed]. Peppered cories can eat their eggs, but will not eat the living fry.  At first, the fry is small (with a mean length of 7.5246 mm[citation needed]) and is unable to eat, sustaining themselves on the last of their yolk sacs. The fry will begin to eat 1\u20133 days after hatching, and will eat the protozoan organisms in the tank and can be fed powdered food at this stage.  By about one month, the fry will start to become rounder and will begin developing adult coloration, eventually becoming miniature versions of the adults[citation needed]. The juveniles will reach adult size at around 1 year of age, although this varies between individuals and how well they are kept. The age of sexual maturity also varies between individuals, but juveniles will typically begin breeding at around 8\u201312 months of age. However, they can begin as early as 6 months and as late as 18 months of age. From the onset of sexual maturity, it can take the fish up to another year to successfully produce fertile eggs; at first, entire clutches of eggs may be infertile. Albino strains may develop slower and be less fertile due to inbreeding. Media related to Corydoras paleatus at Wikimedia Commons"

        "description": " Corydoras pygmaeus, or the pygmy corydoras or pygmy catfish[1] is a tropical and freshwater fish belonging to the subfamily Corydoradinae of the family Callichthyidae. It originates in tropical inland waters in South America, and is found in the Madeira River basin in Brazil. The first scientific description of the pygmy corydoras was published in 1966 by German biologist and physician Joachim Knaack, in Aquarien und Terrarien-Zeitschrift.[2][3] One specimen was designated the holotype and one additional specimen was collected as a paratype.[2] The scientific name uses the Latin word pygmaeus, meaning dwarf or pygmy.[4] A species of Corydoras with a similar appearance, Corydoras hastatus was described in the 1880s, and many specimens that were described as Corydoras hastatus between the 1920s and 1950s were subsequently found to be misidentified specimens of the pygmy corydoras.[1] In older literature, the pygmy corydoras is frequently mislabeled due to Corydoras hastatus being the only miniature Corydoras species known at the time.[1] The pygmy corydoras is a silver-colored fish, with an unbroken black line that runs horizontally along the center of the sides of the fish from the tip of its snout to its caudal peduncle.[5] It has a second thin black line along the lower part of the side of the body, from behind the ventral fins and continuing into the tail.[5] The top part of the body has a light black or dark gray shading that starts on the top of its snout and ends at the tail.[5] Newly hatched fry have vertical stripes along the sides of their bodies that fade by the end of their first month, when the horizontal stripes of the adult fish begin to appear.[5] The maximum length of the species is about 3.2 centimeters (1.3\u00a0in),[6] but typical adult sizes are 1.9 centimeters (0.75\u00a0in) for males and 2.5 centimeters (1.0\u00a0in) for females.[1] In addition to their larger length, females are also rounder and broader than males, especially when they have eggs.[7] Young fry grow rapidly after hatching, reaching 13 millimeters (0.51\u00a0in) in six to eight weeks.[1] The pygmy corydoras is widely distributed in inland waters in Peru in tributaries of the Nanay River, in Ecuador in tributaries of the Aguarico River, and in western Brazil in tributaries of the Madeira River.[8] The holotype was obtained from Calama, Brazil, along the Madeira River near the mouth of the Ji-Paran\u00e1 River.[6] The pygmy corydoras lives in a tropical climate in water with a 6.0 - 8.0 pH,[9] a water hardness of 2 \u2013 25 dGH,[9] and a temperature range of 22\u201326\u00a0\u00b0C (72\u201379\u00a0\u00b0F).[9] It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. The pygmy corydoras lays approximately 100 eggs at a time.[9] The female holds 2\u20134 eggs at a time in a pouch formed by her pelvic fins while they are fertilized by the male, which takes about 30 seconds.[9] The female swims to a safe location with the fertilized eggs, where she attaches the sticky eggs to a surface, where they will remain.[9] It is a peaceful fish, shoaling fish and can be kept in a community aquarium of smaller fish species such as ember tetras. It can be fed most sinking foods, flakes, frozen food and sinking wafers. It can be kept with small shrimp and snails. In aquariums, they are often kept on fine grained substrate, such as sand. This enables them to dig through the substrate without injury to their barbels, which can often be lost in sharp substrates. They are often kept at a pH of between 6.5 and 7.0. They are schooling fish that are usually kept in groups of at least four and will also behave much more naturally in larger groups (10 or more). Unlike the larger more common Corydoras, they often swim in shoals around the mid water and lower regions of the tank. C. pygmaeus are peaceful fish which will not thrive with aggressive tankmates. They are perhaps best kept in a planted species tank, or with shrimp such as Neocaridina spp. They seem to do best when offered live foods in addition to prepared food items. Appropriate foods include microworms or similar nematodes, as well as Artemia nauplii (newly hatched brine shrimp)."

It originates in inland waters in South America, and is found in the Upper Orinoco River basin in Venezuela and Colombia. C. habrosus, is often found in periodic wetlands, large floodplains to where other species migrate seasonally. These small corydoras are prone to entrapment in receding waters, and populations can suffer during the dry season.[2] Their natural habitat tends to be abundant in leaf litter and plant life, providing ample cover to allow these fish to roam moderately freely. As a bottom dwelling species C. habrosus tends to stick to the lower regions of the river, however, on occasion corydoras will dart up to the water surface to take in air. They use their intestines as an air breathing organ to absorb oxygen, and expel the remnant air out of the anus.[3] The fish will grow in length up to 1.4 inches (3.5 centimeters). It lives in a tropical climate in water with a 5.5 \u2013 7.5 pH, a water hardness of 2 \u2013 10 dGH, and a temperature of about 77\u00a0\u00b0F (25\u00a0\u00b0C).[4] The diet consists of worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. It is a peaceful fish and can be kept in a community aquarium of smaller fish species such as ember tetras, clown panchax, endler guppies and small species of rasbora.  It should be kept in groups of at least 6 individuals, ideally 10 or more. A shoal should be kept in a tank that is at least 14 gallons in size.[5] Salt and pepper catfish can be fed most small sinking foods including pellets, flake food and preserved baby brine shrimp. Frozen foods such as baby brine shrimp, rotifers and cyclops can also be fed either regularly or exclusively. In captivity, breeding can be difficult to achieve. Some aquarists report that large water changes with relatively cold water can stimulate habrosus in to spawning.[6] Spawning is marked by obvious behaviours; males will swim close to the female, if multiple males are present they will surround the female swimming from side to side quickly. The female holds an egg visibly under her ventral fin ready for fertilising. The female can then be seen to 'massage' the males belly. The female will then choose an appropriate place to deposit her egg, usually on plants near the substrate, particularly on the underside of the leaves but can also be found on the aquarium glass and decor.  Eggs are rarely placed on the top of the leaves or close to the water surface. The spawning male will protect the female from other males attempting to spawn with her.

        "description": " Sterba's corydoras (Corydoras sterbai) is a member of the South American Corydoras genus of freshwater aquarium catfish and one of the most popular species of Corydoras due to its attractive markings. The fish is native to the Guapor\u00e9 River region between Bolivia and Brazil.[1] Sterba's cory is distinguishable from other Corydoras species as it has white spots on a black background on its head. It is occasionally confused with Corydoras haraldschultzi; the difference is that the latter has a pattern of black dots on a white background on the head.  C. sterbai has recently become available in an albino form and a black form. Like many Corydoras species, Sterba's corydoras is a shoaling catfish, and thus should ideally be kept in groups of 5 or more. In the wild it can be found in Brazil and thus, wild caught fish prefer soft, acidic water. However, Sterba's corydoras is a hardy fish and tank bred specimens have adapted to a wider range of water conditions. However, like almost all fish it will not tolerate high levels of nitrates. Unlike some other catfish they are not good algae eaters, but are good at \"cleaning up\" leftover food and detritus from the substrate. Corydoras sterbai are relatively small for catfish, growing to a maximum size of only 2\u20132.6 inches (5.1\u20136.6\u00a0cm). In captivity Corydoras sterbai readily accepts a wide variety of prepared and frozen foods. Flake food is a good staple diet (which will only be consumed once it has fallen to the bottom) as are sinking pellets or wafers. They relish live and frozen foods such as bloodworm, daphnia and mosquito larvae, but ideally should only be fed such foods once a week due to the high amount of protein in them. It is often problematic to feed Corydoras in aquaria with fast feeding mid-water fish such as tetras as flake and sinking pellets are consumed by such fish before they have hit the bottom and sometimes, even while lying on the substrate. However, this problem can be overcome by placing pellets and flake on the aquarium substrate in caves or under bogwood, or other such areas which are not regularly frequented by mid-water fish. The compatibility of C. sterbai is one of their main selling points as with all other Corydoras species as they are very peaceful catfish and can be kept with other peaceful fish. They should not be kept with overly aggressive bottom dwellers, particularly if there is competition over substrate space as there would be in small tanks or tanks with a large amount of \"furniture\". Ideal companions would be similar sized tetras or particularly, dwarf cichlids. Ideally Corydoras sterbai should be housed with a fine substrate such as sand or gravel in order to avoid doing damage to their delicate barbels. However, large gravel will suffice as long as it is not sharp edged. Their only other requirement is that shade be provided for them, by means of overhanging rock, large leaved plants, arching bogwood or caves. Breeding is not too difficult. A tank with dimensions 18\u2033 x 12\u2033 x 12\u2033 (10 US Gallon) is recommended. The breeding ratio that should be kept is 2 males per female. Good diet together with repeated water changes and drops of temperature are usually sufficient. However, raising the fry is not easy due to its high sensitivity. Occasionally problems can arise while transporting these fish as they are capable of secreting a chemical toxin when stressed or overcrowded. For this reason they are never shipped with other fish. The species name of this Corydoras is in honour of Professor Dr. G\u00fcnther Sterba, professor emeritus of zoology of Leipzig University, member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.[2] Professor Sterba is a professional ichthyologist who nevertheless produced several very popular books regarded as virtual bibles for fishkeepers over the 1970s and 1980s, translated into English under the titles Freshwater Fishes of the World, Aquarium Care and (with Dick Mills) The Aquarists' Encyclopedia, despite his degree of isolation at that time by virtue of living in the then German Democratic Republic."

        "description": " Corydoras julii (also known as the julii cory or leopard catfish[2]) is a small freshwater catfish native to eastern Brazil. It is often confused with Corydoras trilineatus,[3] the three stripe corydoras. Corydoras julii are small, peaceful shoaling fish, and are typically kept in groups in captivity.[4] Corydoras julii is a relatively small species of fish, growing to be no more than 52 millimeters in length.[5] Its skin is a translucent whitish-gray, with fine black spotting across the body and a horizontal stripe which reaches up the mid-body until it is equal with the front base of the dorsal fin. This spotting pattern is the primary visual difference between C. julii and three stripe corydoras (C. trilineatus), which have larger reticulations, as opposed to spots, and a longer mid-body stripe. C. julii might be further distinguished from C. trilineatus by the spotted pattern on its head; however, C. trilineatus can also show this pattern on occasion.[5] Females are typically larger and rounder than males.[6] Corydoras julii, like almost all Corydoras species, are bottom-feeding scavengers. Their diet consists primarily of small invertebrates which they sift from the substrate, expelling the particles of sand and sediment through their gill openings. In captivity, their diet is frequently sinking pellets rich in insect and other invertebrate proteins, as well as live or frozen invertebrates like bloodworms, daphnia, brine shrimp, and California blackworms (Lumbriculus variegatus).[4] After sexual maturity, Corydoras spawning appears to be triggered by storms.[6] During this storm, the fish eat increased amounts of insects. The water gradually decreases temperature over the course of a few days.[6] Corydoras fish breed in a position resembling a \"T formation\". In this formation, the female swims up to the male's abdomen, and consumes sperm released by the male. The sperm rapidly travels though the female's intestinal tract and fertilizes the eggs in the cloaca. Small, white, sturdy eggs are laid on plant leaves in the wild.

It was originally described as Silurus callichthys by Linnaeus in 1758.[1] It is likely to represent a species complex.[2] C. callichthys is distributed in all major river drainages of South America.[2] It is very wide-ranging, extending from Trinidad to  Buenos Aires, Argentina, including the upper Amazon River and Paraguay River systems. The fish will grow in length up to eight inches (20 centimeters).  The females are larger and more robust, and are a dull olive-green, while the males are brighter in color, exhibiting a delicate blue or violet sheen laterally, with a more developed and longer pectoral fin spine that is reddish-brown and edged with orange or reddish-orange. It lives in a variety of water types, from anoxic conditions (slack water zones surrounded by dense vegetation) to slightly turbid, but free-flowing, streams.[1] It can be found in waters with pH range of 5.8 to 8.3, a water hardness of 0\u201330dGH, and a temperature range of 64\u201383\u00a0\u00b0F (18\u201328\u00a0\u00b0C).[1] When its biotype becomes dry, it can move out of the water, due to its ability to swallow air and use its intestines to absorb oxygen from the atmosphere, to find more water.[1] It feeds at night on fish, insects, and plant matter.  Juveniles feed on rotifers, in addition to the microcrustaceans and aquatic insect larvae they find when digging into the substrate.[1] During reproduction, the male's belly turns orange and its pectoral spines become longer and thicker.  The male builds a bubble nest with some floating plants, fiercely guarding it after the female lays down her eggs.[1] The cascarudo is of commercial importance in the aquarium trade industry and of minor importance as a food source.[1] It can be kept in aquariums, with groups of more than five individuals recommended.[1]"

        "description": " Megalechis thoracata (black marble hoplo, spotted hoplo[1]) is a species of catfish of the family Callichthyidae.  M. thoracata is found east of the Andes in the Amazon, Orinoco, and upper Paraguay River basins, as well as in the coastal rivers of the Guianas and northern Brazil. Recent introductions were recorded in the upper Paran\u00e1 River drainage.[2] Overview: The Spotted Hoplo Catfish is an incredibly hardy and relatively easy species to keep in captivity, with the main difficulty being the maximum size of around 6 inches, or 15\u00a0cm.They are a very peaceful fish, with the only exception being when the males are guarding a bubble nest at breeding time. They can be kept with almost all tankmates, but they will likely eat anything that can fit in their mouths due to their opportunistic nature. This rule also applies for larger fish, as the Hoplo may get eaten or have its barbels or fins damaged by large, potentially aggressive fish, such as South American Cichlids, African Cichlids, larger catfish and most larger fish species that can fit the Hoplo in its mouth or shows aggression. Tank Setup: They require a soft sand substrate, as they are bottom dwellers that can often be observed foraging/searching for food. A gentle substrate is essential, as other coarse grained or abrasive substrates can irritate the fish's sensitive barbels, and even cause them to fall off. To thrive in the aquarium, they need a minimum tank size of 55 US liquid gallons, but as a rule of thumb for this fish, the larger the tank, the better.[3][4] They are semi-social creatures that prefer to be kept in groups of at least five, but still seem content alone or in pairs. The spotted hoplo catfish needs hiding places, usually in the form of rocks, wood and plants, such as variations of Anubias, valisineria, java fern and micranthemum. Floating plants are also appreciated, as they provide extra cover. Water Conditions: Despite the Hoplo being a very hardy fish, like all fish they need a mature, cycled tank with the correct parameters for almost all tropical species. As they are a species of tropical fish, the optimal temperature for them is around 24\u201328 degrees Celsius, but they can adapt to temperatures in the 22\u201330 degrees Celsius range, although this is not recommended and over a long period of time this can lead to elevated stress levels, amongst other health concerns. The natural habitat of Megalechis thoracata is slow flowing, low oxygen parts of the  Amazon, Orinoco, and upper Paraguay River basins. For this reason, catfish of the family Callichthyidae among other fish, have developed a unique way of breathing, where the fish will rise to the surface of the water and ingest a small amount of air.[5] The oxygen is then absorbed through the lining of the stomach and intestine. This is known as gastrointestinal respiration. They will feed on small to medium-sized worms and other invertebrates, small fish, and general detritus. M. thoracata has been observed to produce sounds during territorial behavior in males at their nest sites and especially during spawning, and during aggressive behavior in both sexes. M. thoracata males aggressively defend territories against intruders.[6]"

        "description": " The emerald catfish  (Corydoras splendens) is a tropical freshwater fish belonging to the Corydoradinae sub-family of the family Callichthyidae native to the Amazon Basin in South America.[1] It has traditionally been known as Brochis splendens.[2] The fish has appeared on a stamp in Brazil.[3] It was originally described as Callichthys splendens by Fran\u00e7ois Louis de la Porte, comte de Castelnau in 1855.  This species was once also commonly called Brochis coeruleus. W. A. Gosline was the first to suspect that the two species were the same in 1940, but it was actually Njiseen & Isbr\u00fccker, in 1970, who combined the two, giving sufficient reasons for doing so. The species would be described as Brochis splendens, until most of the catfish formerly classified as Brochis were re-classified into Corydoras.[2] The current recognized classification is thus Corydoras splendens.[1] It is native to the upper reaches Amazon Basin.[1] This includes Ucayali River to Pucallpa, Ambiyacu River, and the area around Iquitos in western Brazil, southeastern Colombia, eastern Ecuador and eastern Peru. Depending upon the angle of lighting, the fish's body reflects a metallic green, blue-green, or even a bluish color.  The ventral area is yellowish with the pectoral, ventral, and anal fins yellowish and the dorsal, caudal, and adipose fins a translucent brownish.  The females are larger and more robust than the males, and have a more pinkish belly as opposed to the more yellowish one for the males. This fish can be distinguished from the green/bronze corydoras catfish by its usually larger size, stouter body, and more pointed snout. The fish inhabits sluggish waters with dense vegetation along the banks.[1] It occurs in shallow muddy waters and will grow in length up to 7.5\u00a0centimetres (3\u00a0in).[1] It lives in a tropical climate in water with a 5.8\u20138.0 pH, a water hardness of 2\u201330 dGH, and a temperature range of 22\u201328\u00a0\u00b0C (72\u201382\u00a0\u00b0F).[1] It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, and insect larvae. It lays eggs in dense vegetation and adults do not guard the eggs. The emerald catfish is a common species in freshwater aquaria.  It is a peaceful, undemanding species and can be maintained under the same conditions as most Corydoras species.  They are shy and easily frightened when kept as individuals, so it is best kept in small groups of at least three, with more being recommended.  The tank should have only a soft, fine bottom to prevent damage to barbels and should be heavily planted.[4] Feeding is not difficult and they accept almost anything, although live worms are especially appreciated.[5] It does well in a community tank and does not tear up the plants.[5] Spawning has been achieved in captivity.[4] Typically, the fish are separated into a breeding tank in the ratio of three males to two females, all well-conditioned on live foods.  The couple will spawn while sitting on the bottom, not while swimming as many similar species do. In captivity, the female collects the eggs in her pelvic fin basket and pastes them individually to plants and other objects.  Eggs will be deposited by the female throughout the tank, but especially on any floating surface plants.  According to most reports, the parents do not immediately try to eat the eggs.  The eggs hatch in about four days and the fry become free swimming two days later."

It originates in coastal drainages in South America from Rio de Janeiro to Santa Catarina, Brazil.[2] It was originally described as Callichthys barbatus by Jean Ren\u00e9 Constant Quoy & Joseph Paul Gaimard in 1824, from which it was transferred to genus Corydoras as Corydoras barbatus, a name which by which it is still being referred to in the aquarium industry. The species was further transferred to genus Scleromystax in 2003.[3] The fish will grow in length up to 9.8\u00a0centimetres (3.9\u00a0in).[2] This species has pronounced sexual dimorphism. The dorsal and pectoral fins of males reach, or almost reach, the caudal peduncle, and well-developed odontodes are inserted in fleshy tissue on a large area on the sides of the snout in fully grown males.[4] The banded corydoras lives in a subtropical climate in water with a 6.0\u20138.0 pH, a water hardness of 2\u201325 dGH, and a temperature of 68\u00a0\u00b0F (20\u00a0\u00b0C) to 82\u00a0\u00b0F (28\u00a0\u00b0C).[2] It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. It lays eggs in dense vegetation and adults do not guard the eggs. In captivity, as the sperm are released the female sinks to the bottom, resting on one of her pectoral fins while she starts fanning with the other pectoral fin. At this time, some eggs are released which fall into the pelvic fin basket and are apparently fertilized at that time. The banded corydoras is of commercial importance in the aquarium trade industry. Though peaceful, they get larger than most Corydoras and are therefore less suitable for small aquaria.[5]  This Callichthyidae-related article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it."

        "description": " The bronze corydoras  (Corydoras aeneus), also known as the green corydoras, bronze catfish, lightspot corydoras or wavy catfish, is a species of freshwater fish in the armored catfish family, Callichthyidae, often kept as an aquarium fish. It is widely distributed in South America on the eastern side of the Andes, from Colombia and Trinidad to the R\u00edo de la Plata basin;[2] however, as presently defined it is a species complex and a taxonomic review is necessary.[3] It was originally described as Hoplosoma aeneum (based on a specimen from Trinidad) by Theodore Gill in 1858 and has historically also been referred to as Callichthys aeneus.[2] The adult size is 6\u00bd cm for males and a slightly larger 7\u00a0cm for females (2\u00bd to 2\u00be inches).[4]   Females have a slightly higher body frame than males in accordance with their larger abdominal region. Their average life span is 10 years. It has a yellow or pink body, white belly, and is blue-grey over its head and back. Its fins are yellow or pink and immaculate. In common with most Corydoras the dorsal, pectoral and adipose fins have an additional sharp barb and have a mild poison which causes fish which try to attack them to get stung. A brownish-orange patch is usually present on the head, just before the dorsal fin, and is its most distinctive feature when viewed from above in the stream. Their upper sides are often a greenish color, which is the reason another common name for this fish is the green corydoras. Like many other catfishes, females are larger than males in this species.[5] They are found in quiet, shallow waters with soft bottoms that can sometimes be heavily polluted by clouds of disturbed mud from the bottom, but it also inhabits running waters.[2] In its native habitat, it inhabits waters with a temperature range of 25\u00a0\u00b0C to 28\u00a0\u00b0C (77\u00a0\u00b0F to 82\u00a0\u00b0F), pH 6.0\u20138.0, and hardness 5 to 19 DGH.[2] Like most members of the genus Corydoras, these catfish have a unique method of coping with the low oxygen content that prevails in such environments. In addition to utilizing their gills like any other fish, they rapidly come to the surface of the water and draw air in through their mouth. This air is then absorbed through the wall of the intestine and any surplus air is expelled through the vent.[2] It typically stays in schools of 20 to 30 individuals.[2] It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter.[2] Reproduction occurs with the onset of the rainy season, which changes the water chemistry.[2] Females spawn 10\u201320 egg-clutches with multiple males at a time, but an entire egg clutch is inseminated by the sperm of a single male.[5] In laboratory observations, it was found that bronze corydoras have a unique method of insemination. When these fish reproduce, the male will present his abdomen to the female. The female will attach her mouth to the male's genital opening, creating the well-known \"T-position\" many Corydoras exhibit during courtship. The female will then drink the sperm. The sperm rapidly moves through her intestines and is discharged together with her eggs into a pouch formed by her pelvic fins. The female can then swim away and deposit the pouch somewhere else alone. Because the T-position is exhibited in other species than just C. aeneus, it is likely that they also exhibit this behavior.[6] In the wild, eggs are laid on waterweeds.[5] Males do not form territories or compete over females; interference between males might only happen when two males present their abdomens simultaneously. On the other hand, females do not choose between males. Mating is more or less random; therefore, male reproductive success is directly related to courtship frequency.[5] The eggs of C. aeneus exhibit a unique surface pattern with small villi-like protuberances which resemble attaching-filaments of teleost eggs. These structures allow the eggs to be adhesive and stick to a specific place or to each other. The presence of these structures may be related to the turbid habitat in which this species lives.[7] Bronze corydoras are probably the most popular Corydoras species.[8] It is annually bred and shipped in large quantities all over the world[9] It is easily bred and is produced in commercial quantities in the United States, Europe, and Singapore. Most of the available fish are therefore domestic strains. Wild imports are reported to be less easy to breed.[citation needed] They are a hardy and useful aquarium fish despite having a coloration that is by no means striking or unusual. Many aquarists are fascinated by the habits of these fish. They ceaselessly comb the bottom of the aquarium for food and therefore disturb it slightly, sending up detritus and waste material that has settled loosely on the bottom. They prefer being kept in groups of 5 or more, being sociable fish and are ideal fish for a community tank.[2] Other Corydoras species can be placed in the same aquarium, and despite the strong resemblance many species bear to one another, the species will tend to separate out and only move about among their own kind. Corydoras aeneus is not particular about the composition of the water. Adequate conditions are a temperature range of 20 to 28\u00a0\u00b0C (68 to 82\u00a0\u00b0F), pH of 6.0\u20138.0, and hardness of 2\u201330 DGH. The water should have no salt added to it.[8] A fairly dense growth of plants with a number of possible hiding places is greatly appreciated. Corys are easy to feed, they are omnivores eating all flake and pelleted food and also live and frozen foods. When it comes to sperm, then the female glues the eggs, only a few in number, to the chosen substrate and then (sometimes) quickly touches them with her mouth. After several acts of spawning, which span a total of two to three hours, one female will have produced up to 200 eggs. Frequently, two males are used for each female, as one male has difficulty fertilizing all the eggs. The eggs gradually grow darker in color, and just prior to hatching (ranging from three days at 28\u00a0\u00b0C to a week at 20\u00a0\u00b0C) they turn dark brown. The fry keep to the bottom of the tank, feeding on detritus and any fine foods available. The parents may spawn again within two to three weeks. The albino corydoras is an albino variety of the bronze corydoras that has been developed for the aquarium trade, with a pale pink or orange body and red eyes.  It is physically similar to normally-colored individuals, although some breeders report that the fry are a little slower to develop.[10] Others say that the albinos are practically blind and that the males are somewhat sterile, although this may be due to extensive inbreeding.[11] Albino bronze corydoras are frequently injected with bright dye (via a needle) and sold in aquariums. This controversial practice is known as \"painting\" or \"juicing\" fish."

It lays eggs in dense vegetation, and adults do not guard the eggs. Unlike most Corydoras species but similar to the other \"saddlenoses\", C. narcissus tend to occur in small groups (not larger groups) and especially during the breeding period mature males are quite aggressive towards each other.[3][7] The species was first collected by Herbert R. Axelrod and Martin R. Brittan. It was first described and named narcissus by Han Nijssen and Isa\u00e4c J. H. Isbr\u00fccker to recognize the collectors \"for their many naming suggestions\".[8]"

        "description": " The dwarf corydoras (Corydoras hastatus), dwarf catfish, tail spot pygmy catfish, or micro catfish is a tropical freshwater fish belonging to the subfamily Corydoradinae of the family Callichthyidae.  It originates in inland waters in South America, and is found in the Amazon River and Paraguay River basins in Argentina, Bolivia, and Brazil.[1] The specific epithet hastatus means with a spear, in reference to the spearhead-like spot on the tail root. The body of Corydoras hastatus is typically more elongated than other Corydoras species.  Its body is a translucent white to olive color, with a thin dark stripe on the sides from behind the gill cover to the root of the tail, and a whitish belly.  It has a white crescent at the base of the tail surrounding a black spot.  The fish will grow in length up to 1.4 inches (3.5\u00a0cm), but 1.0 inch (2.5\u00a0cm) is more typical.  Males are smaller, more slender and have a more pointed dorsal fin than females. The dwarf corydoras lives in a (sub)tropical climate in water with a 6.0\u20138.0 pH, a water hardness of 5\u201319 dGH, and a temperature range of 68\u201382 F (20\u201328\u00a0\u00b0C).[1] It is found in ponds.[1] It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. They are found in the Paraguay River and Amazon River basins. C. hastatus lives among plants.[1] It is a schooling species.[1] It differs from most Corydoras species by preferring the midwater areas instead of the bottom, spending most of its time well off the bottom in areas of dense plants.  When it rests, it rests on the leaves of the plants.  Other Corydoras species with similar mid-water habits include C. habrosus and C. pygmaeus. The dwarf Corydoras maintains its position in a current by using rapid fin movements, especially with its pectoral fins. These rapid movements, combined with a high breathing rate, give the fish the appearance of being very \"nervous\" when compared with other fish. C. hastatus may even shoal with small characins. The fish lays its eggs in dense vegetation and the adults do not guard the eggs.  The female holds a single egg between her pelvic fins, where the male fertilizes them for about 30 seconds.  Only then does the female swim to a suitable spot, where she attaches the sticky egg. The pair repeats this process about every three minutes for from one to two hours with some 10- to 15-minute rests between egg releases.  Around 7 to 15 eggs are spawned in a single day, and spawning occurs on three to four consecutive days. A total of 30 to 60 eggs may be spawned by a single female over this period of time. The eggs hatch in three to nine days.  The fry are about 6\u00a0mm long at hatching, mostly translucent but sometimes with spots. In two months, the fry average about 18\u00a0mm in length.  The fry mature in six to eight months. The dwarf corydoras is of commercial importance in the aquarium trade industry.   Due to its small size, this fish can be kept in a relatively small aquarium; a 5-gallon (20 litre) tank is sufficient for a small school.  Since it is a schooling fish, it should only be kept in groups of at least six individuals.  It is a good community tank fish when kept with peaceful tankmates such as tetras, rasboras, and danios, but should not be kept with overly aggressive tankmates.  They have also been used as scavengers for fry tanks. The aquarium should be clean, well-aerated, and densely planted to provide hiding places.  A moderate current provided by a power filter or canister filter is appreciated.  The water should be slightly alkaline (pH about 7.6) within a temperature range of 24\u00b0 to 29\u00a0\u00b0C.  Although the fish is generally a mid-water dweller, a fine gravel or sand substrate should be provided since it will occasionally burrow. The fish will feed both in midwater or on a substrate, whether that substrate is a plant leaf, a broad rock, or the bottom of the tank.  It accepts most foods, including freeze-dried, flake, and frozen foods, although live foods are particularly appreciated. The methods of spawning this fish in the aquarium is similar to spawning most other Corydoras species.  The spawning tank can be as small as 2.5 gallons (10 L), but at least a 5-gallon (20 L) tank is recommended with aged water, a sponge filter and some plants.  Fish should be conditioned with large amounts of live foods such as Tubifex and whiteworms, during which time the females will become noticeably plumper.  Since C. hastatus may spawn as a school, the whole group can be conditioned for spawning at the same time, and for best results, there should be at least two males for every female. Spawning of well-conditioned fish may be initiated by the addition of cooler water.  During spawning, very little food is accepted, but the fish will immediately search for food after finishing.  It will typically attach its eggs to the plants in the aquarium, but if not enough plants are available, the sides of the aquarium may be used.  When the fry hatch, they can be fed newly hatched brine shrimp or microworms.  The parents may be ready to spawn again in a couple of weeks."

It originates in inland waters in South America, and is found in the Upper Amazon River basin in Brazil, Colombia and Peru. The specific epithet elegans means elegant. The fish's appearance is characterized by dark double longitudinal stripes. The dorsal fin is ornamented by a few gray dots, taking on an arching pattern in some individuals. The body has other gray and black markings on an olive background. Compared with other species of Corydoras, the body is not as tall in comparison to its length, and its eyes are set a bit lower. The fish will grow in length up to 5.1 centimetres (2.0 inches). It lives in a tropical climate in water with a 6.0 - 8.0 pH, a water hardness of 2 \u2013 25 dGH, and a temperature range of 22\u201326\u00a0\u00b0C (72\u201379\u00a0\u00b0F). It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. Though it lays eggs in dense vegetation, adults do not guard them. In captivity, the male is reportedly territorial during the prespawning activities while the female is usually hidden among the plant roots. Both sexes clean the underside of plant leaves. Eggs are fastened under the leaves and are also attached to roots of plants. The elegant corydoras is of commercial importance in the aquarium trade industry. It tends to swim in the upper levels of the aquarium, instead of at the bottom as is common with most species of Corydoras, and does not seem to disturb the sediment as much."

        "description": " Corydoras panda is a species of catfish belonging to the genus Corydoras, of the family Callichthyidae, and is a native member of the riverine fauna of South America.  It is found in Peru and Ecuador, most notably in the Hu\u00e1nuco region, where it inhabits the R\u00edo Aquas, the R\u00edo Amarillae, a tributary of the R\u00edo Pachitea, and the R\u00edo Ucayali river system. The species was first collected by Randolph H. Richards in 1968, and was named Corydoras panda by Nijssen and Isbr\u00fccker in 1971. The specific name is an allusion to the appearance of the fish, which possesses large black patches surrounding the eyes, reminiscent of those found on the giant panda. Accordingly, the common names for this fish, which is a popular aquarium species, are panda corydoras and panda catfish. Corydoras panda has an off-white to pinkish-orange ground colour, and when observed under certain lighting conditions, a faint greenish iridescence is present upon the flanks and the operculum. The fins of the fish match the body in ground colour, upon close inspection being seen to be hyaline or translucent with coloured fin rays, with the dorsal fin being marked by a conspicuous black blotch that covers almost the entire fin area. The caudal peduncle is marked with a black band, this black band encircling the caudal peduncle from dorsal to ventral surface. The adipose fin, supported by a small fin spine, sometimes contains black pigmentation. The head is the same ground colour as the body, with a black mask surrounding the eyes, descending vertically from the fontanel, over each eye, and ending in a triangular wedge immediately before the ventral surface of the head. The pectoral fins are positioned immediately behind the operculum, and are usually oriented horizontally when the fish is at rest, extended in a manner similar to the wings of an aeroplane. The pelvic fins are positioned upon the ventral surface of the fish, located some way behind the pectoral fins. The first ray of the dorsal fin emanates from the body at approximately its point of greatest elevation, and a vertical line drawn downwards from this point meets the attachment point of the pelvic fins. The anal fin is located far to the rear of the ventral surface of the body, the attachment point of the first fin ray being somewhat forward of the black caudal peduncle marking described above. In common with all other members of the family Callichthyidae, the body surface is covered, not with scales, but with bony plates known as scutes. The lines of demarcation between individual scutes can be seen upon close examination of this and almost all other Callichthyid fishes, and in the case of some specimens of this species, are highlighted by additional black pigment. The fish possesses, in common with almost all Corydoras species, three pairs of barbels\u2014one pair of maxillary barbels and two pairs of rictal barbels. A fully mature adult specimen of this species attains a standard length of 55 millimetres (2.1\u00a0inches): this is the length attained by mature females, which grow larger than mature males, and also possess more rounded body outlines. Corydoras panda inhabits clear river waters that are relatively fast-flowing, well-oxygenated, and flowing over substrates that may comprise soft sand or fine gravel. These rivers are usually well vegetated with assorted species of aquatic plants. The proximity of the home rivers of the fish to the Andes mountain range, and the replenishment of those rivers with meltwaters from Andean snows at higher altitudes, has led the fish to be adaptable to cooler temperatures than the norm for 'tropical' fishes\u2014the temperature range of the fish is 16\u00a0\u00b0C to 28\u00a0\u00b0C, though the fish exhibits a marked preference for the cooler regions of this temperature spectrum, particularly in captivity. Indeed, the fish can, for small time-periods, survive temperatures as low as 12\u00a0\u00b0C, though captive rearing at such low temperatures is ill-advised. The native waters of Corydoras panda are consequently mineral-deficient, with a neutral to slightly acid pH, and replication of such conditions in captivity are recommended for successful maintenance. Corydoras panda has a preference for cooler than normal waters when compared to many other popular tropical fish species. Because of this, those who keep C. panda in community aquarium setting must choose tankmates that share its preference for cooler temperatures of around 20\u00a0\u00b0C (68\u00a0\u00b0F) to 25\u00a0\u00b0C (77\u00a0\u00b0F).[2] Given the cleanliness of the fish's native waters, scrupulous attention to water quality in the aquarium is considerably more important for this fish than for the more domesticated Corydoras species such as C. paleatus or C. aeneus. Additionally, scrupulous attention to aquarium substrate cleanliness is a must, as the fish are intolerant of poor aquarium maintenance in this area, and succumb to stress and disease rapidly if their aquaria are not kept to a high standard. Despite this, the species remains highly popular with aquarists, upon account of the appearance of the fish, and its lively, vivacious behaviour in a well-planned aquarium setting. Like many other Corydoras species, the panda catfish is a highly gregarious fish, and in common with several other smaller Corydoras species such as C. habrosus and C. pygmaeus, manifests a distinct need for numerous companions of its own species in order to thrive, and can thus be described as being more avowedly social than some of the larger members of the genus. A minimum of eight individuals should be housed in the same aquarium, and if space permits, this number should be revised upwards, as the fish exhibits a very definite preference for grouping together with others of its species. They also associate themselves easily with the clown loach and school together in currents where sufficient numbers of their own species is lacking. An aquarium for this species should be well furnished, ideally with a mixture of live aquatic plants, and solid furnishings providing caves, sheltered areas and hiding places to give the fish security. Floating plants to provide additional areas of shade are also welcomed by the fish. Like all Corydoras species, the fish feeds primarily upon animal matter. The aquarist is advised, however, that the traditional use of Corydoras catfishes as putative 'scavengers' in an aquarium setting will be detrimental to the well-being of this species\u2014it requires high quality foods for long-term maintenance, and a varied diet. Ideally, the fish should be given live foods at least intermittently, and will dine enthusiastically upon such items as Bloodworms (larvae of Chironomus midges), Daphnia, cultivated Brine Shrimp (Atermia salina), and Tubifex worms. The last, however, should be cultivated in order to minimise the risk of introducing pathogenic organisms to the aquarium, as Tubifex live in unsanitary conditions in the wild. Freeze dried Tubifex may be preferable, as the risk of introduction of disease is eliminated. High quality flake foods are also appreciated, particularly those containing shrimp or other similar matter. The lifespan of Corydoras panda in the aquarium has not been systematically determined, but given the longevity of other Corydoras species in the aquarium, it is reasonable to assume that well-cared for specimens will enjoy a lifespan in excess of ten years, and frequently in excess of 15 years. Corydoras panda follows, with a few minor deviations, the standard model for breeding for the genus. Stimulus for breeding consists of the influx of cooler, oxygenated waters into their habitat, usually corresponding in the wild with the onset of the rainy season. However, while some Corydoras species require a temperature drop in the aquarium for spawning to be stimulated, in the case of Corydoras panda, the temperature drop appears to matter much less, as specimens have spawned in the aquarium without a temperature drop. The addition of new, clean, oxygenated water appears to be the primary stimulus for this species. In the wild, the appearance of new water courtesy of the rains is followed by an increase in the populations of assorted food organisms, and feeding upon these conditions the fishes for breeding. Once conditioned fish are stimulated into spawning, males begin chasing females energetically. Females begin developing eggs within their reproductive tracts, and when 'ripe' (laden with eggs), become receptive to the attentions of the males. Eventually, one male will succeed in courting a female, using his barbels to provide stimulation to the female, usually beginning with caresses of the female's caudal peduncle, followed by caresses of the fontanel and the front of the head. if the female is receptive, then the male positions himself before the female, so that the female's mouth is in close proximity with one of the male's pectoral fins. The male then clasps the female's barbels between the pectoral fin and the body, and this stimulates the female to press against the male's side. When seen from above, the fish form a 'T' shape when conjoined thus, hence the term 'T position' has become conventional in aquarium circles when describing the breeding of Corydoras catfishes. Once the male and female are in the 'T position', the pressing of the female against the male's body stimulates his release of sperm. Though the exact mechanism of fertilisation has yet to be scientifically documented, from the observations of aquarists who have been successful in breeding Corydoras catfishes, it seems likely that the female takes the male's sperm through her mouthparts, and directs them through the gills, in a current that carries the sperm to her pelvic fins. At this point, the female releases a single egg (occasionally two), and purses her pelvic fins in order to provide a receptacle for the freshly extruded egg, which is then fertilised. One difference observed between the adoption of the 'T position' in Corydoras panda, when compared to other Corydoras species, is that the exercise is frequently more acrobatic in appearance, with the 'T position' being adopted in mid-water, some distance above the substrate, rather than resting upon the substrate as is the case with the majority of other Corydoras. Once the female is carrying a fertilised egg within her pelvic fins, she then seeks an egg deposition site. The choice of such a site is frequently, though not always, a mass of fine leaved aquatic vegetation. In the aquarium, the plant known as Java moss, Vesicularia dubayana, is of considerable utility as an egg repository for Corydoras catfishes, even though the plant is not a South American native, and panda catfish females will choose large clumps of this plant readily as safe deposition sites for fertilised eggs. The female is frequently pursued by one or more males as she seeks the deposition site, each male presumably seeking to be the chosen mate to fertilise the next egg. Up to 25 eggs may be produced by a single female during a single spawning, which may take place over four to five hours. Fertile Corydoras panda eggs require approximately 3\u20134 days development time before hatching, if kept at a temperature of 22\u00a0\u00b0C. This development time will vary with temperature, taking longer in cooler water. Upon hatching, the fry are four millimetres long, translucent, but already possessing the basic ground colour of the species, and upon close examination, possess fully formed barbels. Even newly hatched fry possess at least some hint of the adult eye patches, and as the fry grow, these patches darken and become more prominent. Even so, at just four millimetres in length, the fry are practically invisible against typical aquarium gravel unless seen to move. The fry take approximately four weeks to develop to the point where the finfold, a continuous undifferentiated membrane resembling that seen at the posterior of a tadpole, has differentiated into the unpaired fins (dorsal, anal and caudal fins). During this time, size will have increased to approximately eight or nine millimetres, and the fish will begin to develop colour changes leading to that of the adult fish. From this point, the caudal peduncle patch and dorsal fin patch will begin to appear, but the body will also be seen to be covered in fine black 'pepper dots' between these black patches. Only after a period of 10 to 12 weeks, at which point the fish has assumed a size of 12 to 14 millimetres, will the fish attain the colouration of the adult, and be in all respects a perfect miniature of the parents. Fry of this species are particularly sensitive to changes in water chemistry and to elevated temperatures. While adult fishes can withstand temperatures of 28\u00a0\u00b0C, fry will die of heat stress if exposed to temperatures above 26\u00a0\u00b0C, and their chances of survival are enhanced if the water temperature is kept at 22\u00a0\u00b0C or below. Water changes made to a nursery aquarium during the first 21 days of life of the fry\u2014the critical period during which they manifest the greatest sensitivity to their environment\u2014must be gradual, and the incoming water conditioned to match that of the existing aquarium water where possible before the water change takes place. While the fry are likely to develop best if given infusoria as part of their feeding r\u00e9gime, it is possible to raise fry to adulthood entirely upon prepared foods."

        "description": " Corydoras paleatus is a species of catfish (order Siluriformes) of the family Callichthyidae. Its common names include blue leopard corydoras, mottled corydoras, and peppered catfish.[1] It originates from the lower Paran\u00e1 River basin and coastal rivers in Uruguay and Brazil.[1] This fish species reach about 5.9 - 7 centimeters (2.3 - 2.75 \u00a0in) SL.[1] The male is smaller than the female, and in proportion to body length, the dorsal fin and pectoral fins are longer on the male than the female.[2] Corydoras paleatus is found in the Amazon basin,[1] and feeds on worms, crustaceans, insects, and plant matter.[1] C. paleatus has been known to produce sound; it does this by the abduction of its pectoral fins. This is used by males during courtship and intrapersonal communication, and by both sexes and juveniles when distressed.[2] In reproduction, males do not behave aggressively toward each other, nor do they monopolize mating areas or females.[2] The T-position is involved in courtship, as with many other Corydoras species.[2] Charles Darwin discovered the C. paleatus when he went to Buenos Aires during his expedition aboard the Beagle during the 1830s.[3] It is a very good choice for the community aquarium, as it is a hardy,[4] good-looking, and peaceful fish.[4] They can be successfully kept with other small, peaceful aquarium fish like livebearers, danios, and tetras. It is sometimes seen in the shops as an albino form, although this is similar to other albino corys (see the C. aeneus albino form). It grows to around 7.5\u00a0cm and is easily bred at home. These fish prefer a planted tank with temperatures around 16 to 24 \u00b0C (61 \u2013 75 \u00b0F), although they can take lower temperatures than this as it originates from colder waters.[3] Their high temperature tolerance seems poor, and 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F) is the highest safe temperature. They like to nibble on the algae that grow on floating plants but are not specialized algae-eating catfish. The lighting must not be too bright, and hiding places, such as bogwood, are needed as they like to hide from the light during certain parts of the day. Heavily planted areas should also be provided, where the light is minimized, as they like darker areas due to their bottom-feeding nature. Diet should be sinking pellets, algae wafers, frozen and live food, such as bloodworm or daphnia. They may also occasionally enjoy blanched spinach, which can be attached to plants with a peg or the side of the glass with magnetic clips. They can be seen to dart to the top of the tank: this is because they can use atmospheric oxygen to supplement what their gills extract from the water.[5] They will do this more frequently  when water quality is starting to deteriorate, and so should be watched for this indication. Peppered corydoras reach their sexual maturity and start to show reproductive behaviors once the females reach an average (minimum) size of 5.625 cm (2.214 inches) and once the males reach about 4.875 cm (1.919 inches).[citation needed] The males initiate the courtship ritual, which entails chasing the females around the tank. The female darts away, and the males search for her and find her a few moments later. The males shiver all over the female and may lie down on top of her. When she is ready to spawn, she turns to the male next to her and pounds below his ventral fin. The pair go into the \"T-position\" with the male releasing the sperm into the female's mouth before the sperm fertilizes the eggs[citation needed]. The female cups her ventral fins and lays a few eggs (usually between 4 and 12 eggs[citation needed]) in her fins.  The eggs are about 1.8 mm in diameter[citation needed]. The female now starts cleaning a spot on the glass to put her eggs on. Corydoras are egg depositors and lay their eggs all over the aquarium. Favorite spots include the heater, filters, and the glass, although, occasionally eggs are also laid on plants and driftwood. After depositing a group of eggs closely together, the female rests for a few moments. The males regroup and start chasing each other and then resume chasing the female. The males are so relentless in this pursuit that they try to mate with the female even while she is busy laying her eggs. The spawning lasts more than an hour, and many eggs are laid in different places. On average, about 50 to 150 eggs are laid during a single spawning[citation needed]. The incubation period for the eggs for peppered corydoras was found to be between 96 hours and 113 hours at 24\u00b12\u00b0C, with the average incubation period being about 102 hours (or 4.25 days)[citation needed]. In one study, the average hatching ratio of the eggs was found to be approximately 87%, with the overall egg-laying period lasting between 20 and 35 days[citation needed]. Peppered cories can eat their eggs, but will not eat the living fry.  At first, the fry is small (with a mean length of 7.5246 mm[citation needed]) and is unable to eat, sustaining themselves on the last of their yolk sacs. The fry will begin to eat 1\u20133 days after hatching, and will eat the protozoan organisms in the tank and can be fed powdered food at this stage.  By about one month, the fry will start to become rounder and will begin developing adult coloration, eventually becoming miniature versions of the adults[citation needed]. The juveniles will reach adult size at around 1 year of age, although this varies between individuals and how well they are kept. The age of sexual maturity also varies between individuals, but juveniles will typically begin breeding at around 8\u201312 months of age. However, they can begin as early as 6 months and as late as 18 months of age. From the onset of sexual maturity, it can take the fish up to another year to successfully produce fertile eggs; at first, entire clutches of eggs may be infertile. Albino strains may develop slower and be less fertile due to inbreeding. Media related to Corydoras paleatus at Wikimedia Commons"

        "description": " Corydoras pygmaeus, or the pygmy corydoras or pygmy catfish[1] is a tropical and freshwater fish belonging to the subfamily Corydoradinae of the family Callichthyidae. It originates in tropical inland waters in South America, and is found in the Madeira River basin in Brazil. The first scientific description of the pygmy corydoras was published in 1966 by German biologist and physician Joachim Knaack, in Aquarien und Terrarien-Zeitschrift.[2][3] One specimen was designated the holotype and one additional specimen was collected as a paratype.[2] The scientific name uses the Latin word pygmaeus, meaning dwarf or pygmy.[4] A species of Corydoras with a similar appearance, Corydoras hastatus was described in the 1880s, and many specimens that were described as Corydoras hastatus between the 1920s and 1950s were subsequently found to be misidentified specimens of the pygmy corydoras.[1] In older literature, the pygmy corydoras is frequently mislabeled due to Corydoras hastatus being the only miniature Corydoras species known at the time.[1] The pygmy corydoras is a silver-colored fish, with an unbroken black line that runs horizontally along the center of the sides of the fish from the tip of its snout to its caudal peduncle.[5] It has a second thin black line along the lower part of the side of the body, from behind the ventral fins and continuing into the tail.[5] The top part of the body has a light black or dark gray shading that starts on the top of its snout and ends at the tail.[5] Newly hatched fry have vertical stripes along the sides of their bodies that fade by the end of their first month, when the horizontal stripes of the adult fish begin to appear.[5] The maximum length of the species is about 3.2 centimeters (1.3\u00a0in),[6] but typical adult sizes are 1.9 centimeters (0.75\u00a0in) for males and 2.5 centimeters (1.0\u00a0in) for females.[1] In addition to their larger length, females are also rounder and broader than males, especially when they have eggs.[7] Young fry grow rapidly after hatching, reaching 13 millimeters (0.51\u00a0in) in six to eight weeks.[1] The pygmy corydoras is widely distributed in inland waters in Peru in tributaries of the Nanay River, in Ecuador in tributaries of the Aguarico River, and in western Brazil in tributaries of the Madeira River.[8] The holotype was obtained from Calama, Brazil, along the Madeira River near the mouth of the Ji-Paran\u00e1 River.[6] The pygmy corydoras lives in a tropical climate in water with a 6.0 - 8.0 pH,[9] a water hardness of 2 \u2013 25 dGH,[9] and a temperature range of 22\u201326\u00a0\u00b0C (72\u201379\u00a0\u00b0F).[9] It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. The pygmy corydoras lays approximately 100 eggs at a time.[9] The female holds 2\u20134 eggs at a time in a pouch formed by her pelvic fins while they are fertilized by the male, which takes about 30 seconds.[9] The female swims to a safe location with the fertilized eggs, where she attaches the sticky eggs to a surface, where they will remain.[9] It is a peaceful fish, shoaling fish and can be kept in a community aquarium of smaller fish species such as ember tetras. It can be fed most sinking foods, flakes, frozen food and sinking wafers. It can be kept with small shrimp and snails. In aquariums, they are often kept on fine grained substrate, such as sand. This enables them to dig through the substrate without injury to their barbels, which can often be lost in sharp substrates. They are often kept at a pH of between 6.5 and 7.0. They are schooling fish that are usually kept in groups of at least four and will also behave much more naturally in larger groups (10 or more). Unlike the larger more common Corydoras, they often swim in shoals around the mid water and lower regions of the tank. C. pygmaeus are peaceful fish which will not thrive with aggressive tankmates. They are perhaps best kept in a planted species tank, or with shrimp such as Neocaridina spp. They seem to do best when offered live foods in addition to prepared food items. Appropriate foods include microworms or similar nematodes, as well as Artemia nauplii (newly hatched brine shrimp)."

It originates in inland waters in South America, and is found in the Upper Orinoco River basin in Venezuela and Colombia. C. habrosus, is often found in periodic wetlands, large floodplains to where other species migrate seasonally. These small corydoras are prone to entrapment in receding waters, and populations can suffer during the dry season.[2] Their natural habitat tends to be abundant in leaf litter and plant life, providing ample cover to allow these fish to roam moderately freely. As a bottom dwelling species C. habrosus tends to stick to the lower regions of the river, however, on occasion corydoras will dart up to the water surface to take in air. They use their intestines as an air breathing organ to absorb oxygen, and expel the remnant air out of the anus.[3] The fish will grow in length up to 1.4 inches (3.5 centimeters). It lives in a tropical climate in water with a 5.5 \u2013 7.5 pH, a water hardness of 2 \u2013 10 dGH, and a temperature of about 77\u00a0\u00b0F (25\u00a0\u00b0C).[4] The diet consists of worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. It is a peaceful fish and can be kept in a community aquarium of smaller fish species such as ember tetras, clown panchax, endler guppies and small species of rasbora.  It should be kept in groups of at least 6 individuals, ideally 10 or more. A shoal should be kept in a tank that is at least 14 gallons in size.[5] Salt and pepper catfish can be fed most small sinking foods including pellets, flake food and preserved baby brine shrimp. Frozen foods such as baby brine shrimp, rotifers and cyclops can also be fed either regularly or exclusively. In captivity, breeding can be difficult to achieve. Some aquarists report that large water changes with relatively cold water can stimulate habrosus in to spawning.[6] Spawning is marked by obvious behaviours; males will swim close to the female, if multiple males are present they will surround the female swimming from side to side quickly. The female holds an egg visibly under her ventral fin ready for fertilising. The female can then be seen to 'massage' the males belly. The female will then choose an appropriate place to deposit her egg, usually on plants near the substrate, particularly on the underside of the leaves but can also be found on the aquarium glass and decor.  Eggs are rarely placed on the top of the leaves or close to the water surface. The spawning male will protect the female from other males attempting to spawn with her.

        "description": " Sterba's corydoras (Corydoras sterbai) is a member of the South American Corydoras genus of freshwater aquarium catfish and one of the most popular species of Corydoras due to its attractive markings. The fish is native to the Guapor\u00e9 River region between Bolivia and Brazil.[1] Sterba's cory is distinguishable from other Corydoras species as it has white spots on a black background on its head. It is occasionally confused with Corydoras haraldschultzi; the difference is that the latter has a pattern of black dots on a white background on the head.  C. sterbai has recently become available in an albino form and a black form. Like many Corydoras species, Sterba's corydoras is a shoaling catfish, and thus should ideally be kept in groups of 5 or more. In the wild it can be found in Brazil and thus, wild caught fish prefer soft, acidic water. However, Sterba's corydoras is a hardy fish and tank bred specimens have adapted to a wider range of water conditions. However, like almost all fish it will not tolerate high levels of nitrates. Unlike some other catfish they are not good algae eaters, but are good at \"cleaning up\" leftover food and detritus from the substrate. Corydoras sterbai are relatively small for catfish, growing to a maximum size of only 2\u20132.6 inches (5.1\u20136.6\u00a0cm). In captivity Corydoras sterbai readily accepts a wide variety of prepared and frozen foods. Flake food is a good staple diet (which will only be consumed once it has fallen to the bottom) as are sinking pellets or wafers. They relish live and frozen foods such as bloodworm, daphnia and mosquito larvae, but ideally should only be fed such foods once a week due to the high amount of protein in them. It is often problematic to feed Corydoras in aquaria with fast feeding mid-water fish such as tetras as flake and sinking pellets are consumed by such fish before they have hit the bottom and sometimes, even while lying on the substrate. However, this problem can be overcome by placing pellets and flake on the aquarium substrate in caves or under bogwood, or other such areas which are not regularly frequented by mid-water fish. The compatibility of C. sterbai is one of their main selling points as with all other Corydoras species as they are very peaceful catfish and can be kept with other peaceful fish. They should not be kept with overly aggressive bottom dwellers, particularly if there is competition over substrate space as there would be in small tanks or tanks with a large amount of \"furniture\". Ideal companions would be similar sized tetras or particularly, dwarf cichlids. Ideally Corydoras sterbai should be housed with a fine substrate such as sand or gravel in order to avoid doing damage to their delicate barbels. However, large gravel will suffice as long as it is not sharp edged. Their only other requirement is that shade be provided for them, by means of overhanging rock, large leaved plants, arching bogwood or caves. Breeding is not too difficult. A tank with dimensions 18\u2033 x 12\u2033 x 12\u2033 (10 US Gallon) is recommended. The breeding ratio that should be kept is 2 males per female. Good diet together with repeated water changes and drops of temperature are usually sufficient. However, raising the fry is not easy due to its high sensitivity. Occasionally problems can arise while transporting these fish as they are capable of secreting a chemical toxin when stressed or overcrowded. For this reason they are never shipped with other fish. The species name of this Corydoras is in honour of Professor Dr. G\u00fcnther Sterba, professor emeritus of zoology of Leipzig University, member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.[2] Professor Sterba is a professional ichthyologist who nevertheless produced several very popular books regarded as virtual bibles for fishkeepers over the 1970s and 1980s, translated into English under the titles Freshwater Fishes of the World, Aquarium Care and (with Dick Mills) The Aquarists' Encyclopedia, despite his degree of isolation at that time by virtue of living in the then German Democratic Republic."

The female holds two to four eggs between her pelvic fins, where the male fertilizes them for about 30 seconds.  Only then does the female swim to a suitable spot, where she attaches the very sticky eggs. The pair repeats this process until about 100 eggs have been fertilized and attached.[citation needed] The three-stripe corydoras is of commercial importance in the aquarium trade industry. It is often mistakenly sold as Corydoras julii since C. julii also has a horizontal stripe running along the sides of its body. The distinct difference between C. trilineatus and C. julii is in their markings. The hardier and more adaptable C. trilineatus has reticulations, while C. julii is distinguished by its \"leopard\" spots, although there is also a spotted form of C. trilineatus. They are best differentiated by the stripes on the side. In C. trilineatus, the stripes are much more pronounced and solid than in C. julii.[citation needed]  This Callichthyidae-related article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it."

        "description": " Corydoras julii (also known as the julii cory or leopard catfish[2]) is a small freshwater catfish native to eastern Brazil. It is often confused with Corydoras trilineatus,[3] the three stripe corydoras. Corydoras julii are small, peaceful shoaling fish, and are typically kept in groups in captivity.[4] Corydoras julii is a relatively small species of fish, growing to be no more than 52 millimeters in length.[5] Its skin is a translucent whitish-gray, with fine black spotting across the body and a horizontal stripe which reaches up the mid-body until it is equal with the front base of the dorsal fin. This spotting pattern is the primary visual difference between C. julii and three stripe corydoras (C. trilineatus), which have larger reticulations, as opposed to spots, and a longer mid-body stripe. C. julii might be further distinguished from C. trilineatus by the spotted pattern on its head; however, C. trilineatus can also show this pattern on occasion.[5] Females are typically larger and rounder than males.[6] Corydoras julii, like almost all Corydoras species, are bottom-feeding scavengers. Their diet consists primarily of small invertebrates which they sift from the substrate, expelling the particles of sand and sediment through their gill openings. In captivity, their diet is frequently sinking pellets rich in insect and other invertebrate proteins, as well as live or frozen invertebrates like bloodworms, daphnia, brine shrimp, and California blackworms (Lumbriculus variegatus).[4] After sexual maturity, Corydoras spawning appears to be triggered by storms.[6] During this storm, the fish eat increased amounts of insects. The water gradually decreases temperature over the course of a few days.[6] Corydoras fish breed in a position resembling a \"T formation\". In this formation, the female swims up to the male's abdomen, and consumes sperm released by the male. The sperm rapidly travels though the female's intestinal tract and fertilizes the eggs in the cloaca. Small, white, sturdy eggs are laid on plant leaves in the wild. Adult corydoras have been known to eat their own eggs.[6]"

It was originally described as Silurus callichthys by Linnaeus in 1758.[1] It is likely to represent a species complex.[2] C. callichthys is distributed in all major river drainages of South America.[2] It is very wide-ranging, extending from Trinidad to  Buenos Aires, Argentina, including the upper Amazon River and Paraguay River systems. The fish will grow in length up to eight inches (20 centimeters).  The females are larger and more robust, and are a dull olive-green, while the males are brighter in color, exhibiting a delicate blue or violet sheen laterally, with a more developed and longer pectoral fin spine that is reddish-brown and edged with orange or reddish-orange. It lives in a variety of water types, from anoxic conditions (slack water zones surrounded by dense vegetation) to slightly turbid, but free-flowing, streams.[1] It can be found in waters with pH range of 5.8 to 8.3, a water hardness of 0\u201330dGH, and a temperature range of 64\u201383\u00a0\u00b0F (18\u201328\u00a0\u00b0C).[1] When its biotype becomes dry, it can move out of the water, due to its ability to swallow air and use its intestines to absorb oxygen from the atmosphere, to find more water.[1] It feeds at night on fish, insects, and plant matter.  Juveniles feed on rotifers, in addition to the microcrustaceans and aquatic insect larvae they find when digging into the substrate.[1] During reproduction, the male's belly turns orange and its pectoral spines become longer and thicker.  The male builds a bubble nest with some floating plants, fiercely guarding it after the female lays down her eggs.[1] The cascarudo is of commercial importance in the aquarium trade industry and of minor importance as a food source.[1] It can be kept in aquariums, with groups of more than five individuals recommended.[1]"

        "description": " Megalechis thoracata (black marble hoplo, spotted hoplo[1]) is a species of catfish of the family Callichthyidae.  M. thoracata is found east of the Andes in the Amazon, Orinoco, and upper Paraguay River basins, as well as in the coastal rivers of the Guianas and northern Brazil. Recent introductions were recorded in the upper Paran\u00e1 River drainage.[2] Overview: The Spotted Hoplo Catfish is an incredibly hardy and relatively easy species to keep in captivity, with the main difficulty being the maximum size of around 6 inches, or 15\u00a0cm.They are a very peaceful fish, with the only exception being when the males are guarding a bubble nest at breeding time. They can be kept with almost all tankmates, but they will likely eat anything that can fit in their mouths due to their opportunistic nature. This rule also applies for larger fish, as the Hoplo may get eaten or have its barbels or fins damaged by large, potentially aggressive fish, such as South American Cichlids, African Cichlids, larger catfish and most larger fish species that can fit the Hoplo in its mouth or shows aggression. Tank Setup: They require a soft sand substrate, as they are bottom dwellers that can often be observed foraging/searching for food. A gentle substrate is essential, as other coarse grained or abrasive substrates can irritate the fish's sensitive barbels, and even cause them to fall off. To thrive in the aquarium, they need a minimum tank size of 55 US liquid gallons, but as a rule of thumb for this fish, the larger the tank, the better.[3][4] They are semi-social creatures that prefer to be kept in groups of at least five, but still seem content alone or in pairs. The spotted hoplo catfish needs hiding places, usually in the form of rocks, wood and plants, such as variations of Anubias, valisineria, java fern and micranthemum. Floating plants are also appreciated, as they provide extra cover. Water Conditions: Despite the Hoplo being a very hardy fish, like all fish they need a mature, cycled tank with the correct parameters for almost all tropical species. As they are a species of tropical fish, the optimal temperature for them is around 24\u201328 degrees Celsius, but they can adapt to temperatures in the 22\u201330 degrees Celsius range, although this is not recommended and over a long period of time this can lead to elevated stress levels, amongst other health concerns. The natural habitat of Megalechis thoracata is slow flowing, low oxygen parts of the  Amazon, Orinoco, and upper Paraguay River basins. For this reason, catfish of the family Callichthyidae among other fish, have developed a unique way of breathing, where the fish will rise to the surface of the water and ingest a small amount of air.[5] The oxygen is then absorbed through the lining of the stomach and intestine. This is known as gastrointestinal respiration. They will feed on small to medium-sized worms and other invertebrates, small fish, and general detritus. M. thoracata has been observed to produce sounds during territorial behavior in males at their nest sites and especially during spawning, and during aggressive behavior in both sexes. M. thoracata males aggressively defend territories against intruders.[6]"

This species was once also commonly called Brochis coeruleus. W. A. Gosline was the first to suspect that the two species were the same in 1940, but it was actually Njiseen & Isbr\u00fccker, in 1970, who combined the two, giving sufficient reasons for doing so. The species would be described as Brochis splendens, until most of the catfish formerly classified as Brochis were re-classified into Corydoras.[2] The current recognized classification is thus Corydoras splendens.[1] It is native to the upper reaches Amazon Basin.[1] This includes Ucayali River to Pucallpa, Ambiyacu River, and the area around Iquitos in western Brazil, southeastern Colombia, eastern Ecuador and eastern Peru. Depending upon the angle of lighting, the fish's body reflects a metallic green, blue-green, or even a bluish color.  The ventral area is yellowish with the pectoral, ventral, and anal fins yellowish and the dorsal, caudal, and adipose fins a translucent brownish.  The females are larger and more robust than the males, and have a more pinkish belly as opposed to the more yellowish one for the males. This fish can be distinguished from the green/bronze corydoras catfish by its usually larger size, stouter body, and more pointed snout. The fish inhabits sluggish waters with dense vegetation along the banks.[1] It occurs in shallow muddy waters and will grow in length up to 7.5\u00a0centimetres (3\u00a0in).[1] It lives in a tropical climate in water with a 5.8\u20138.0 pH, a water hardness of 2\u201330 dGH, and a temperature range of 22\u201328\u00a0\u00b0C (72\u201382\u00a0\u00b0F).[1] It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, and insect larvae. It lays eggs in dense vegetation and adults do not guard the eggs. The emerald catfish is a common species in freshwater aquaria.  It is a peaceful, undemanding species and can be maintained under the same conditions as most Corydoras species.  They are shy and easily frightened when kept as individuals, so it is best kept in small groups of at least three, with more being recommended.  The tank should have only a soft, fine bottom to prevent damage to barbels and should be heavily planted.[4] Feeding is not difficult and they accept almost anything, although live worms are especially appreciated.[5] It does well in a community tank and does not tear up the plants.[5] Spawning has been achieved in captivity.[4] Typically, the fish are separated into a breeding tank in the ratio of three males to two females, all well-conditioned on live foods.  The couple will spawn while sitting on the bottom, not while swimming as many similar species do. In captivity, the female collects the eggs in her pelvic fin basket and pastes them individually to plants and other objects.  Eggs will be deposited by the female throughout the tank, but especially on any floating surface plants.  According to most reports, the parents do not immediately try to eat the eggs.  The eggs hatch in about four days and the fry become free swimming two days later."

        "description": " The banded corydoras or bearded catfish (Scleromystax barbatus) is a subtropical freshwater fish belonging to the subfamily Corydoradinae of the family Callichthyidae. It originates in coastal drainages in South America from Rio de Janeiro to Santa Catarina, Brazil.[2] It was originally described as Callichthys barbatus by Jean Ren\u00e9 Constant Quoy & Joseph Paul Gaimard in 1824, from which it was transferred to genus Corydoras as Corydoras barbatus, a name which by which it is still being referred to in the aquarium industry. The species was further transferred to genus Scleromystax in 2003.[3] The fish will grow in length up to 9.8\u00a0centimetres (3.9\u00a0in).[2] This species has pronounced sexual dimorphism. The dorsal and pectoral fins of males reach, or almost reach, the caudal peduncle, and well-developed odontodes are inserted in fleshy tissue on a large area on the sides of the snout in fully grown males.[4] The banded corydoras lives in a subtropical climate in water with a 6.0\u20138.0 pH, a water hardness of 2\u201325 dGH, and a temperature of 68\u00a0\u00b0F (20\u00a0\u00b0C) to 82\u00a0\u00b0F (28\u00a0\u00b0C).[2] It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. It lays eggs in dense vegetation and adults do not guard the eggs. In captivity, as the sperm are released the female sinks to the bottom, resting on one of her pectoral fins while she starts fanning with the other pectoral fin. At this time, some eggs are released which fall into the pelvic fin basket and are apparently fertilized at that time. The banded corydoras is of commercial importance in the aquarium trade industry. Though peaceful, they get larger than most Corydoras and are therefore less suitable for small aquaria.[5]  This Callichthyidae-related article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it."

        "description": " The bronze corydoras  (Corydoras aeneus), also known as the green corydoras, bronze catfish, lightspot corydoras or wavy catfish, is a species of freshwater fish in the armored catfish family, Callichthyidae, often kept as an aquarium fish. It is widely distributed in South America on the eastern side of the Andes, from Colombia and Trinidad to the R\u00edo de la Plata basin;[2] however, as presently defined it is a species complex and a taxonomic review is necessary.[3] It was originally described as Hoplosoma aeneum (based on a specimen from Trinidad) by Theodore Gill in 1858 and has historically also been referred to as Callichthys aeneus.[2] The adult size is 6\u00bd cm for males and a slightly larger 7\u00a0cm for females (2\u00bd to 2\u00be inches).[4]   Females have a slightly higher body frame than males in accordance with their larger abdominal region. Their average life span is 10 years. It has a yellow or pink body, white belly, and is blue-grey over its head and back. Its fins are yellow or pink and immaculate. In common with most Corydoras the dorsal, pectoral and adipose fins have an additional sharp barb and have a mild poison which causes fish which try to attack them to get stung. A brownish-orange patch is usually present on the head, just before the dorsal fin, and is its most distinctive feature when viewed from above in the stream. Their upper sides are often a greenish color, which is the reason another common name for this fish is the green corydoras. Like many other catfishes, females are larger than males in this species.[5] They are found in quiet, shallow waters with soft bottoms that can sometimes be heavily polluted by clouds of disturbed mud from the bottom, but it also inhabits running waters.[2] In its native habitat, it inhabits waters with a temperature range of 25\u00a0\u00b0C to 28\u00a0\u00b0C (77\u00a0\u00b0F to 82\u00a0\u00b0F), pH 6.0\u20138.0, and hardness 5 to 19 DGH.[2] Like most members of the genus Corydoras, these catfish have a unique method of coping with the low oxygen content that prevails in such environments. In addition to utilizing their gills like any other fish, they rapidly come to the surface of the water and draw air in through their mouth. This air is then absorbed through the wall of the intestine and any surplus air is expelled through the vent.[2] It typically stays in schools of 20 to 30 individuals.[2] It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter.[2] Reproduction occurs with the onset of the rainy season, which changes the water chemistry.[2] Females spawn 10\u201320 egg-clutches with multiple males at a time, but an entire egg clutch is inseminated by the sperm of a single male.[5] In laboratory observations, it was found that bronze corydoras have a unique method of insemination. When these fish reproduce, the male will present his abdomen to the female. The female will attach her mouth to the male's genital opening, creating the well-known \"T-position\" many Corydoras exhibit during courtship. The female will then drink the sperm. The sperm rapidly moves through her intestines and is discharged together with her eggs into a pouch formed by her pelvic fins. The female can then swim away and deposit the pouch somewhere else alone. Because the T-position is exhibited in other species than just C. aeneus, it is likely that they also exhibit this behavior.[6] In the wild, eggs are laid on waterweeds.[5] Males do not form territories or compete over females; interference between males might only happen when two males present their abdomens simultaneously. On the other hand, females do not choose between males. Mating is more or less random; therefore, male reproductive success is directly related to courtship frequency.[5] The eggs of C. aeneus exhibit a unique surface pattern with small villi-like protuberances which resemble attaching-filaments of teleost eggs. These structures allow the eggs to be adhesive and stick to a specific place or to each other. The presence of these structures may be related to the turbid habitat in which this species lives.[7] Bronze corydoras are probably the most popular Corydoras species.[8] It is annually bred and shipped in large quantities all over the world[9] It is easily bred and is produced in commercial quantities in the United States, Europe, and Singapore. Most of the available fish are therefore domestic strains. Wild imports are reported to be less easy to breed.[citation needed] They are a hardy and useful aquarium fish despite having a coloration that is by no means striking or unusual. Many aquarists are fascinated by the habits of these fish. They ceaselessly comb the bottom of the aquarium for food and therefore disturb it slightly, sending up detritus and waste material that has settled loosely on the bottom. They prefer being kept in groups of 5 or more, being sociable fish and are ideal fish for a community tank.[2] Other Corydoras species can be placed in the same aquarium, and despite the strong resemblance many species bear to one another, the species will tend to separate out and only move about among their own kind. Corydoras aeneus is not particular about the composition of the water. Adequate conditions are a temperature range of 20 to 28\u00a0\u00b0C (68 to 82\u00a0\u00b0F), pH of 6.0\u20138.0, and hardness of 2\u201330 DGH. The water should have no salt added to it.[8] A fairly dense growth of plants with a number of possible hiding places is greatly appreciated. Corys are easy to feed, they are omnivores eating all flake and pelleted food and also live and frozen foods. When it comes to sperm, then the female glues the eggs, only a few in number, to the chosen substrate and then (sometimes) quickly touches them with her mouth. After several acts of spawning, which span a total of two to three hours, one female will have produced up to 200 eggs. Frequently, two males are used for each female, as one male has difficulty fertilizing all the eggs. The eggs gradually grow darker in color, and just prior to hatching (ranging from three days at 28\u00a0\u00b0C to a week at 20\u00a0\u00b0C) they turn dark brown. The fry keep to the bottom of the tank, feeding on detritus and any fine foods available. The parents may spawn again within two to three weeks. The albino corydoras is an albino variety of the bronze corydoras that has been developed for the aquarium trade, with a pale pink or orange body and red eyes.  It is physically similar to normally-colored individuals, although some breeders report that the fry are a little slower to develop.[10] Others say that the albinos are practically blind and that the males are somewhat sterile, although this may be due to extensive inbreeding.[11] Albino bronze corydoras are frequently injected with bright dye (via a needle) and sold in aquariums. This controversial practice is known as \"painting\" or \"juicing\" fish."

        "description": " The dwarf corydoras (Corydoras hastatus), dwarf catfish, tail spot pygmy catfish, or micro catfish is a tropical freshwater fish belonging to the subfamily Corydoradinae of the family Callichthyidae.  It originates in inland waters in South America, and is found in the Amazon River and Paraguay River basins in Argentina, Bolivia, and Brazil.[1] The specific epithet hastatus means with a spear, in reference to the spearhead-like spot on the tail root. The body of Corydoras hastatus is typically more elongated than other Corydoras species.  Its body is a translucent white to olive color, with a thin dark stripe on the sides from behind the gill cover to the root of the tail, and a whitish belly.  It has a white crescent at the base of the tail surrounding a black spot.  The fish will grow in length up to 1.4 inches (3.5\u00a0cm), but 1.0 inch (2.5\u00a0cm) is more typical.  Males are smaller, more slender and have a more pointed dorsal fin than females. The dwarf corydoras lives in a (sub)tropical climate in water with a 6.0\u20138.0 pH, a water hardness of 5\u201319 dGH, and a temperature range of 68\u201382 F (20\u201328\u00a0\u00b0C).[1] It is found in ponds.[1] It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. They are found in the Paraguay River and Amazon River basins. C. hastatus lives among plants.[1] It is a schooling species.[1] It differs from most Corydoras species by preferring the midwater areas instead of the bottom, spending most of its time well off the bottom in areas of dense plants.  When it rests, it rests on the leaves of the plants.  Other Corydoras species with similar mid-water habits include C. habrosus and C. pygmaeus. The dwarf Corydoras maintains its position in a current by using rapid fin movements, especially with its pectoral fins. These rapid movements, combined with a high breathing rate, give the fish the appearance of being very \"nervous\" when compared with other fish. C. hastatus may even shoal with small characins. The fish lays its eggs in dense vegetation and the adults do not guard the eggs.  The female holds a single egg between her pelvic fins, where the male fertilizes them for about 30 seconds.  Only then does the female swim to a suitable spot, where she attaches the sticky egg. The pair repeats this process about every three minutes for from one to two hours with some 10- to 15-minute rests between egg releases.  Around 7 to 15 eggs are spawned in a single day, and spawning occurs on three to four consecutive days. A total of 30 to 60 eggs may be spawned by a single female over this period of time. The eggs hatch in three to nine days.  The fry are about 6\u00a0mm long at hatching, mostly translucent but sometimes with spots. In two months, the fry average about 18\u00a0mm in length.  The fry mature in six to eight months. The dwarf corydoras is of commercial importance in the aquarium trade industry.   Due to its small size, this fish can be kept in a relatively small aquarium; a 5-gallon (20 litre) tank is sufficient for a small school.  Since it is a schooling fish, it should only be kept in groups of at least six individuals.  It is a good community tank fish when kept with peaceful tankmates such as tetras, rasboras, and danios, but should not be kept with overly aggressive tankmates.  They have also been used as scavengers for fry tanks. The aquarium should be clean, well-aerated, and densely planted to provide hiding places.  A moderate current provided by a power filter or canister filter is appreciated.  The water should be slightly alkaline (pH about 7.6) within a temperature range of 24\u00b0 to 29\u00a0\u00b0C.  Although the fish is generally a mid-water dweller, a fine gravel or sand substrate should be provided since it will occasionally burrow. The fish will feed both in midwater or on a substrate, whether that substrate is a plant leaf, a broad rock, or the bottom of the tank.  It accepts most foods, including freeze-dried, flake, and frozen foods, although live foods are particularly appreciated. The methods of spawning this fish in the aquarium is similar to spawning most other Corydoras species.  The spawning tank can be as small as 2.5 gallons (10 L), but at least a 5-gallon (20 L) tank is recommended with aged water, a sponge filter and some plants.  Fish should be conditioned with large amounts of live foods such as Tubifex and whiteworms, during which time the females will become noticeably plumper.  Since C. hastatus may spawn as a school, the whole group can be conditioned for spawning at the same time, and for best results, there should be at least two males for every female. Spawning of well-conditioned fish may be initiated by the addition of cooler water.  During spawning, very little food is accepted, but the fish will immediately search for food after finishing.  It will typically attach its eggs to the plants in the aquarium, but if not enough plants are available, the sides of the aquarium may be used.  When the fry hatch, they can be fed newly hatched brine shrimp or microworms.  The parents may be ready to spawn again in a couple of weeks."

It originates in inland waters in South America, and is found in the Upper Amazon River basin in Brazil, Colombia and Peru. The specific epithet elegans means elegant. The fish's appearance is characterized by dark double longitudinal stripes. The dorsal fin is ornamented by a few gray dots, taking on an arching pattern in some individuals. The body has other gray and black markings on an olive background. Compared with other species of Corydoras, the body is not as tall in comparison to its length, and its eyes are set a bit lower. The fish will grow in length up to 5.1 centimetres (2.0 inches). It lives in a tropical climate in water with a 6.0 - 8.0 pH, a water hardness of 2 \u2013 25 dGH, and a temperature range of 22\u201326\u00a0\u00b0C (72\u201379\u00a0\u00b0F). It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. Though it lays eggs in dense vegetation, adults do not guard them. In captivity, the male is reportedly territorial during the prespawning activities while the female is usually hidden among the plant roots. Both sexes clean the underside of plant leaves. Eggs are fastened under the leaves and are also attached to roots of plants. The elegant corydoras is of commercial importance in the aquarium trade industry. It tends to swim in the upper levels of the aquarium, instead of at the bottom as is common with most species of Corydoras, and does not seem to disturb the sediment as much."

        "description": " Corydoras panda is a species of catfish belonging to the genus Corydoras, of the family Callichthyidae, and is a native member of the riverine fauna of South America.  It is found in Peru and Ecuador, most notably in the Hu\u00e1nuco region, where it inhabits the R\u00edo Aquas, the R\u00edo Amarillae, a tributary of the R\u00edo Pachitea, and the R\u00edo Ucayali river system. The species was first collected by Randolph H. Richards in 1968, and was named Corydoras panda by Nijssen and Isbr\u00fccker in 1971. The specific name is an allusion to the appearance of the fish, which possesses large black patches surrounding the eyes, reminiscent of those found on the giant panda. Accordingly, the common names for this fish, which is a popular aquarium species, are panda corydoras and panda catfish. Corydoras panda has an off-white to pinkish-orange ground colour, and when observed under certain lighting conditions, a faint greenish iridescence is present upon the flanks and the operculum. The fins of the fish match the body in ground colour, upon close inspection being seen to be hyaline or translucent with coloured fin rays, with the dorsal fin being marked by a conspicuous black blotch that covers almost the entire fin area. The caudal peduncle is marked with a black band, this black band encircling the caudal peduncle from dorsal to ventral surface. The adipose fin, supported by a small fin spine, sometimes contains black pigmentation. The head is the same ground colour as the body, with a black mask surrounding the eyes, descending vertically from the fontanel, over each eye, and ending in a triangular wedge immediately before the ventral surface of the head. The pectoral fins are positioned immediately behind the operculum, and are usually oriented horizontally when the fish is at rest, extended in a manner similar to the wings of an aeroplane. The pelvic fins are positioned upon the ventral surface of the fish, located some way behind the pectoral fins. The first ray of the dorsal fin emanates from the body at approximately its point of greatest elevation, and a vertical line drawn downwards from this point meets the attachment point of the pelvic fins. The anal fin is located far to the rear of the ventral surface of the body, the attachment point of the first fin ray being somewhat forward of the black caudal peduncle marking described above. In common with all other members of the family Callichthyidae, the body surface is covered, not with scales, but with bony plates known as scutes. The lines of demarcation between individual scutes can be seen upon close examination of this and almost all other Callichthyid fishes, and in the case of some specimens of this species, are highlighted by additional black pigment. The fish possesses, in common with almost all Corydoras species, three pairs of barbels\u2014one pair of maxillary barbels and two pairs of rictal barbels. A fully mature adult specimen of this species attains a standard length of 55 millimetres (2.1\u00a0inches): this is the length attained by mature females, which grow larger than mature males, and also possess more rounded body outlines. Corydoras panda inhabits clear river waters that are relatively fast-flowing, well-oxygenated, and flowing over substrates that may comprise soft sand or fine gravel. These rivers are usually well vegetated with assorted species of aquatic plants. The proximity of the home rivers of the fish to the Andes mountain range, and the replenishment of those rivers with meltwaters from Andean snows at higher altitudes, has led the fish to be adaptable to cooler temperatures than the norm for 'tropical' fishes\u2014the temperature range of the fish is 16\u00a0\u00b0C to 28\u00a0\u00b0C, though the fish exhibits a marked preference for the cooler regions of this temperature spectrum, particularly in captivity. Indeed, the fish can, for small time-periods, survive temperatures as low as 12\u00a0\u00b0C, though captive rearing at such low temperatures is ill-advised. The native waters of Corydoras panda are consequently mineral-deficient, with a neutral to slightly acid pH, and replication of such conditions in captivity are recommended for successful maintenance. Corydoras panda has a preference for cooler than normal waters when compared to many other popular tropical fish species. Because of this, those who keep C. panda in community aquarium setting must choose tankmates that share its preference for cooler temperatures of around 20\u00a0\u00b0C (68\u00a0\u00b0F) to 25\u00a0\u00b0C (77\u00a0\u00b0F).[2] Given the cleanliness of the fish's native waters, scrupulous attention to water quality in the aquarium is considerably more important for this fish than for the more domesticated Corydoras species such as C. paleatus or C. aeneus. Additionally, scrupulous attention to aquarium substrate cleanliness is a must, as the fish are intolerant of poor aquarium maintenance in this area, and succumb to stress and disease rapidly if their aquaria are not kept to a high standard. Despite this, the species remains highly popular with aquarists, upon account of the appearance of the fish, and its lively, vivacious behaviour in a well-planned aquarium setting. Like many other Corydoras species, the panda catfish is a highly gregarious fish, and in common with several other smaller Corydoras species such as C. habrosus and C. pygmaeus, manifests a distinct need for numerous companions of its own species in order to thrive, and can thus be described as being more avowedly social than some of the larger members of the genus. A minimum of eight individuals should be housed in the same aquarium, and if space permits, this number should be revised upwards, as the fish exhibits a very definite preference for grouping together with others of its species. They also associate themselves easily with the clown loach and school together in currents where sufficient numbers of their own species is lacking. An aquarium for this species should be well furnished, ideally with a mixture of live aquatic plants, and solid furnishings providing caves, sheltered areas and hiding places to give the fish security. Floating plants to provide additional areas of shade are also welcomed by the fish. Like all Corydoras species, the fish feeds primarily upon animal matter. The aquarist is advised, however, that the traditional use of Corydoras catfishes as putative 'scavengers' in an aquarium setting will be detrimental to the well-being of this species\u2014it requires high quality foods for long-term maintenance, and a varied diet. Ideally, the fish should be given live foods at least intermittently, and will dine enthusiastically upon such items as Bloodworms (larvae of Chironomus midges), Daphnia, cultivated Brine Shrimp (Atermia salina), and Tubifex worms. The last, however, should be cultivated in order to minimise the risk of introducing pathogenic organisms to the aquarium, as Tubifex live in unsanitary conditions in the wild. Freeze dried Tubifex may be preferable, as the risk of introduction of disease is eliminated. High quality flake foods are also appreciated, particularly those containing shrimp or other similar matter. The lifespan of Corydoras panda in the aquarium has not been systematically determined, but given the longevity of other Corydoras species in the aquarium, it is reasonable to assume that well-cared for specimens will enjoy a lifespan in excess of ten years, and frequently in excess of 15 years. Corydoras panda follows, with a few minor deviations, the standard model for breeding for the genus. Stimulus for breeding consists of the influx of cooler, oxygenated waters into their habitat, usually corresponding in the wild with the onset of the rainy season. However, while some Corydoras species require a temperature drop in the aquarium for spawning to be stimulated, in the case of Corydoras panda, the temperature drop appears to matter much less, as specimens have spawned in the aquarium without a temperature drop. The addition of new, clean, oxygenated water appears to be the primary stimulus for this species. In the wild, the appearance of new water courtesy of the rains is followed by an increase in the populations of assorted food organisms, and feeding upon these conditions the fishes for breeding. Once conditioned fish are stimulated into spawning, males begin chasing females energetically. Females begin developing eggs within their reproductive tracts, and when 'ripe' (laden with eggs), become receptive to the attentions of the males. Eventually, one male will succeed in courting a female, using his barbels to provide stimulation to the female, usually beginning with caresses of the female's caudal peduncle, followed by caresses of the fontanel and the front of the head. if the female is receptive, then the male positions himself before the female, so that the female's mouth is in close proximity with one of the male's pectoral fins. The male then clasps the female's barbels between the pectoral fin and the body, and this stimulates the female to press against the male's side. When seen from above, the fish form a 'T' shape when conjoined thus, hence the term 'T position' has become conventional in aquarium circles when describing the breeding of Corydoras catfishes. Once the male and female are in the 'T position', the pressing of the female against the male's body stimulates his release of sperm. Though the exact mechanism of fertilisation has yet to be scientifically documented, from the observations of aquarists who have been successful in breeding Corydoras catfishes, it seems likely that the female takes the male's sperm through her mouthparts, and directs them through the gills, in a current that carries the sperm to her pelvic fins. At this point, the female releases a single egg (occasionally two), and purses her pelvic fins in order to provide a receptacle for the freshly extruded egg, which is then fertilised. One difference observed between the adoption of the 'T position' in Corydoras panda, when compared to other Corydoras species, is that the exercise is frequently more acrobatic in appearance, with the 'T position' being adopted in mid-water, some distance above the substrate, rather than resting upon the substrate as is the case with the majority of other Corydoras. Once the female is carrying a fertilised egg within her pelvic fins, she then seeks an egg deposition site. The choice of such a site is frequently, though not always, a mass of fine leaved aquatic vegetation. In the aquarium, the plant known as Java moss, Vesicularia dubayana, is of considerable utility as an egg repository for Corydoras catfishes, even though the plant is not a South American native, and panda catfish females will choose large clumps of this plant readily as safe deposition sites for fertilised eggs. The female is frequently pursued by one or more males as she seeks the deposition site, each male presumably seeking to be the chosen mate to fertilise the next egg. Up to 25 eggs may be produced by a single female during a single spawning, which may take place over four to five hours. Fertile Corydoras panda eggs require approximately 3\u20134 days development time before hatching, if kept at a temperature of 22\u00a0\u00b0C. This development time will vary with temperature, taking longer in cooler water. Upon hatching, the fry are four millimetres long, translucent, but already possessing the basic ground colour of the species, and upon close examination, possess fully formed barbels. Even newly hatched fry possess at least some hint of the adult eye patches, and as the fry grow, these patches darken and become more prominent. Even so, at just four millimetres in length, the fry are practically invisible against typical aquarium gravel unless seen to move. The fry take approximately four weeks to develop to the point where the finfold, a continuous undifferentiated membrane resembling that seen at the posterior of a tadpole, has differentiated into the unpaired fins (dorsal, anal and caudal fins). During this time, size will have increased to approximately eight or nine millimetres, and the fish will begin to develop colour changes leading to that of the adult fish. From this point, the caudal peduncle patch and dorsal fin patch will begin to appear, but the body will also be seen to be covered in fine black 'pepper dots' between these black patches. Only after a period of 10 to 12 weeks, at which point the fish has assumed a size of 12 to 14 millimetres, will the fish attain the colouration of the adult, and be in all respects a perfect miniature of the parents. Fry of this species are particularly sensitive to changes in water chemistry and to elevated temperatures. While adult fishes can withstand temperatures of 28\u00a0\u00b0C, fry will die of heat stress if exposed to temperatures above 26\u00a0\u00b0C, and their chances of survival are enhanced if the water temperature is kept at 22\u00a0\u00b0C or below. Water changes made to a nursery aquarium during the first 21 days of life of the fry\u2014the critical period during which they manifest the greatest sensitivity to their environment\u2014must be gradual, and the incoming water conditioned to match that of the existing aquarium water where possible before the water change takes place. While the fry are likely to develop best if given infusoria as part of their feeding r\u00e9gime, it is possible to raise fry to adulthood entirely upon prepared foods."

        "description": " Corydoras paleatus is a species of catfish (order Siluriformes) of the family Callichthyidae. Its common names include blue leopard corydoras, mottled corydoras, and peppered catfish.[1] It originates from the lower Paran\u00e1 River basin and coastal rivers in Uruguay and Brazil.[1] This fish species reach about 5.9 - 7 centimeters (2.3 - 2.75 \u00a0in) SL.[1] The male is smaller than the female, and in proportion to body length, the dorsal fin and pectoral fins are longer on the male than the female.[2] Corydoras paleatus is found in the Amazon basin,[1] and feeds on worms, crustaceans, insects, and plant matter.[1] C. paleatus has been known to produce sound; it does this by the abduction of its pectoral fins. This is used by males during courtship and intrapersonal communication, and by both sexes and juveniles when distressed.[2] In reproduction, males do not behave aggressively toward each other, nor do they monopolize mating areas or females.[2] The T-position is involved in courtship, as with many other Corydoras species.[2] Charles Darwin discovered the C. paleatus when he went to Buenos Aires during his expedition aboard the Beagle during the 1830s.[3] It is a very good choice for the community aquarium, as it is a hardy,[4] good-looking, and peaceful fish.[4] They can be successfully kept with other small, peaceful aquarium fish like livebearers, danios, and tetras. It is sometimes seen in the shops as an albino form, although this is similar to other albino corys (see the C. aeneus albino form). It grows to around 7.5\u00a0cm and is easily bred at home. These fish prefer a planted tank with temperatures around 16 to 24 \u00b0C (61 \u2013 75 \u00b0F), although they can take lower temperatures than this as it originates from colder waters.[3] Their high temperature tolerance seems poor, and 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F) is the highest safe temperature. They like to nibble on the algae that grow on floating plants but are not specialized algae-eating catfish. The lighting must not be too bright, and hiding places, such as bogwood, are needed as they like to hide from the light during certain parts of the day. Heavily planted areas should also be provided, where the light is minimized, as they like darker areas due to their bottom-feeding nature. Diet should be sinking pellets, algae wafers, frozen and live food, such as bloodworm or daphnia. They may also occasionally enjoy blanched spinach, which can be attached to plants with a peg or the side of the glass with magnetic clips. They can be seen to dart to the top of the tank: this is because they can use atmospheric oxygen to supplement what their gills extract from the water.[5] They will do this more frequently  when water quality is starting to deteriorate, and so should be watched for this indication. Peppered corydoras reach their sexual maturity and start to show reproductive behaviors once the females reach an average (minimum) size of 5.625 cm (2.214 inches) and once the males reach about 4.875 cm (1.919 inches).[citation needed] The males initiate the courtship ritual, which entails chasing the females around the tank. The female darts away, and the males search for her and find her a few moments later. The males shiver all over the female and may lie down on top of her. When she is ready to spawn, she turns to the male next to her and pounds below his ventral fin. The pair go into the \"T-position\" with the male releasing the sperm into the female's mouth before the sperm fertilizes the eggs[citation needed]. The female cups her ventral fins and lays a few eggs (usually between 4 and 12 eggs[citation needed]) in her fins.  The eggs are about 1.8 mm in diameter[citation needed]. The female now starts cleaning a spot on the glass to put her eggs on. Corydoras are egg depositors and lay their eggs all over the aquarium. Favorite spots include the heater, filters, and the glass, although, occasionally eggs are also laid on plants and driftwood. After depositing a group of eggs closely together, the female rests for a few moments. The males regroup and start chasing each other and then resume chasing the female. The males are so relentless in this pursuit that they try to mate with the female even while she is busy laying her eggs. The spawning lasts more than an hour, and many eggs are laid in different places. On average, about 50 to 150 eggs are laid during a single spawning[citation needed]. The incubation period for the eggs for peppered corydoras was found to be between 96 hours and 113 hours at 24\u00b12\u00b0C, with the average incubation period being about 102 hours (or 4.25 days)[citation needed]. In one study, the average hatching ratio of the eggs was found to be approximately 87%, with the overall egg-laying period lasting between 20 and 35 days[citation needed]. Peppered cories can eat their eggs, but will not eat the living fry.  At first, the fry is small (with a mean length of 7.5246 mm[citation needed]) and is unable to eat, sustaining themselves on the last of their yolk sacs. The fry will begin to eat 1\u20133 days after hatching, and will eat the protozoan organisms in the tank and can be fed powdered food at this stage.  By about one month, the fry will start to become rounder and will begin developing adult coloration, eventually becoming miniature versions of the adults[citation needed]. The juveniles will reach adult size at around 1 year of age, although this varies between individuals and how well they are kept. The age of sexual maturity also varies between individuals, but juveniles will typically begin breeding at around 8\u201312 months of age. However, they can begin as early as 6 months and as late as 18 months of age. From the onset of sexual maturity, it can take the fish up to another year to successfully produce fertile eggs; at first, entire clutches of eggs may be infertile. Albino strains may develop slower and be less fertile due to inbreeding. Media related to Corydoras paleatus at Wikimedia Commons"

        "description": " Corydoras pygmaeus, or the pygmy corydoras or pygmy catfish[1] is a tropical and freshwater fish belonging to the subfamily Corydoradinae of the family Callichthyidae. It originates in tropical inland waters in South America, and is found in the Madeira River basin in Brazil. The first scientific description of the pygmy corydoras was published in 1966 by German biologist and physician Joachim Knaack, in Aquarien und Terrarien-Zeitschrift.[2][3] One specimen was designated the holotype and one additional specimen was collected as a paratype.[2] The scientific name uses the Latin word pygmaeus, meaning dwarf or pygmy.[4] A species of Corydoras with a similar appearance, Corydoras hastatus was described in the 1880s, and many specimens that were described as Corydoras hastatus between the 1920s and 1950s were subsequently found to be misidentified specimens of the pygmy corydoras.[1] In older literature, the pygmy corydoras is frequently mislabeled due to Corydoras hastatus being the only miniature Corydoras species known at the time.[1] The pygmy corydoras is a silver-colored fish, with an unbroken black line that runs horizontally along the center of the sides of the fish from the tip of its snout to its caudal peduncle.[5] It has a second thin black line along the lower part of the side of the body, from behind the ventral fins and continuing into the tail.[5] The top part of the body has a light black or dark gray shading that starts on the top of its snout and ends at the tail.[5] Newly hatched fry have vertical stripes along the sides of their bodies that fade by the end of their first month, when the horizontal stripes of the adult fish begin to appear.[5] The maximum length of the species is about 3.2 centimeters (1.3\u00a0in),[6] but typical adult sizes are 1.9 centimeters (0.75\u00a0in) for males and 2.5 centimeters (1.0\u00a0in) for females.[1] In addition to their larger length, females are also rounder and broader than males, especially when they have eggs.[7] Young fry grow rapidly after hatching, reaching 13 millimeters (0.51\u00a0in) in six to eight weeks.[1] The pygmy corydoras is widely distributed in inland waters in Peru in tributaries of the Nanay River, in Ecuador in tributaries of the Aguarico River, and in western Brazil in tributaries of the Madeira River.[8] The holotype was obtained from Calama, Brazil, along the Madeira River near the mouth of the Ji-Paran\u00e1 River.[6] The pygmy corydoras lives in a tropical climate in water with a 6.0 - 8.0 pH,[9] a water hardness of 2 \u2013 25 dGH,[9] and a temperature range of 22\u201326\u00a0\u00b0C (72\u201379\u00a0\u00b0F).[9] It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. The pygmy corydoras lays approximately 100 eggs at a time.[9] The female holds 2\u20134 eggs at a time in a pouch formed by her pelvic fins while they are fertilized by the male, which takes about 30 seconds.[9] The female swims to a safe location with the fertilized eggs, where she attaches the sticky eggs to a surface, where they will remain.[9] It is a peaceful fish, shoaling fish and can be kept in a community aquarium of smaller fish species such as ember tetras. It can be fed most sinking foods, flakes, frozen food and sinking wafers. It can be kept with small shrimp and snails. In aquariums, they are often kept on fine grained substrate, such as sand. This enables them to dig through the substrate without injury to their barbels, which can often be lost in sharp substrates. They are often kept at a pH of between 6.5 and 7.0. They are schooling fish that are usually kept in groups of at least four and will also behave much more naturally in larger groups (10 or more). Unlike the larger more common Corydoras, they often swim in shoals around the mid water and lower regions of the tank. C. pygmaeus are peaceful fish which will not thrive with aggressive tankmates. They are perhaps best kept in a planted species tank, or with shrimp such as Neocaridina spp. They seem to do best when offered live foods in addition to prepared food items. Appropriate foods include microworms or similar nematodes, as well as Artemia nauplii (newly hatched brine shrimp)."

It originates in inland waters in South America, and is found in the Upper Orinoco River basin in Venezuela and Colombia. C. habrosus, is often found in periodic wetlands, large floodplains to where other species migrate seasonally. These small corydoras are prone to entrapment in receding waters, and populations can suffer during the dry season.[2] Their natural habitat tends to be abundant in leaf litter and plant life, providing ample cover to allow these fish to roam moderately freely. As a bottom dwelling species C. habrosus tends to stick to the lower regions of the river, however, on occasion corydoras will dart up to the water surface to take in air. They use their intestines as an air breathing organ to absorb oxygen, and expel the remnant air out of the anus.[3] The fish will grow in length up to 1.4 inches (3.5 centimeters). It lives in a tropical climate in water with a 5.5 \u2013 7.5 pH, a water hardness of 2 \u2013 10 dGH, and a temperature of about 77\u00a0\u00b0F (25\u00a0\u00b0C).[4] The diet consists of worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. It is a peaceful fish and can be kept in a community aquarium of smaller fish species such as ember tetras, clown panchax, endler guppies and small species of rasbora.  It should be kept in groups of at least 6 individuals, ideally 10 or more. A shoal should be kept in a tank that is at least 14 gallons in size.[5] Salt and pepper catfish can be fed most small sinking foods including pellets, flake food and preserved baby brine shrimp. Frozen foods such as baby brine shrimp, rotifers and cyclops can also be fed either regularly or exclusively. In captivity, breeding can be difficult to achieve. Some aquarists report that large water changes with relatively cold water can stimulate habrosus in to spawning.[6] Spawning is marked by obvious behaviours; males will swim close to the female, if multiple males are present they will surround the female swimming from side to side quickly. The female holds an egg visibly under her ventral fin ready for fertilising. The female can then be seen to 'massage' the males belly. The female will then choose an appropriate place to deposit her egg, usually on plants near the substrate, particularly on the underside of the leaves but can also be found on the aquarium glass and decor.  Eggs are rarely placed on the top of the leaves or close to the water surface. The spawning male will protect the female from other males attempting to spawn with her.

        "description": " Sterba's corydoras (Corydoras sterbai) is a member of the South American Corydoras genus of freshwater aquarium catfish and one of the most popular species of Corydoras due to its attractive markings. The fish is native to the Guapor\u00e9 River region between Bolivia and Brazil.[1] Sterba's cory is distinguishable from other Corydoras species as it has white spots on a black background on its head. It is occasionally confused with Corydoras haraldschultzi; the difference is that the latter has a pattern of black dots on a white background on the head.  C. sterbai has recently become available in an albino form and a black form. Like many Corydoras species, Sterba's corydoras is a shoaling catfish, and thus should ideally be kept in groups of 5 or more. In the wild it can be found in Brazil and thus, wild caught fish prefer soft, acidic water. However, Sterba's corydoras is a hardy fish and tank bred specimens have adapted to a wider range of water conditions. However, like almost all fish it will not tolerate high levels of nitrates. Unlike some other catfish they are not good algae eaters, but are good at \"cleaning up\" leftover food and detritus from the substrate. Corydoras sterbai are relatively small for catfish, growing to a maximum size of only 2\u20132.6 inches (5.1\u20136.6\u00a0cm). In captivity Corydoras sterbai readily accepts a wide variety of prepared and frozen foods. Flake food is a good staple diet (which will only be consumed once it has fallen to the bottom) as are sinking pellets or wafers. They relish live and frozen foods such as bloodworm, daphnia and mosquito larvae, but ideally should only be fed such foods once a week due to the high amount of protein in them. It is often problematic to feed Corydoras in aquaria with fast feeding mid-water fish such as tetras as flake and sinking pellets are consumed by such fish before they have hit the bottom and sometimes, even while lying on the substrate. However, this problem can be overcome by placing pellets and flake on the aquarium substrate in caves or under bogwood, or other such areas which are not regularly frequented by mid-water fish. The compatibility of C. sterbai is one of their main selling points as with all other Corydoras species as they are very peaceful catfish and can be kept with other peaceful fish. They should not be kept with overly aggressive bottom dwellers, particularly if there is competition over substrate space as there would be in small tanks or tanks with a large amount of \"furniture\". Ideal companions would be similar sized tetras or particularly, dwarf cichlids. Ideally Corydoras sterbai should be housed with a fine substrate such as sand or gravel in order to avoid doing damage to their delicate barbels. However, large gravel will suffice as long as it is not sharp edged. Their only other requirement is that shade be provided for them, by means of overhanging rock, large leaved plants, arching bogwood or caves. Breeding is not too difficult. A tank with dimensions 18\u2033 x 12\u2033 x 12\u2033 (10 US Gallon) is recommended. The breeding ratio that should be kept is 2 males per female. Good diet together with repeated water changes and drops of temperature are usually sufficient. However, raising the fry is not easy due to its high sensitivity. Occasionally problems can arise while transporting these fish as they are capable of secreting a chemical toxin when stressed or overcrowded. For this reason they are never shipped with other fish. The species name of this Corydoras is in honour of Professor Dr. G\u00fcnther Sterba, professor emeritus of zoology of Leipzig University, member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.[2] Professor Sterba is a professional ichthyologist who nevertheless produced several very popular books regarded as virtual bibles for fishkeepers over the 1970s and 1980s, translated into English under the titles Freshwater Fishes of the World, Aquarium Care and (with Dick Mills) The Aquarists' Encyclopedia, despite his degree of isolation at that time by virtue of living in the then German Democratic Republic."

        "description": " Corydoras julii (also known as the julii cory or leopard catfish[2]) is a small freshwater catfish native to eastern Brazil. It is often confused with Corydoras trilineatus,[3] the three stripe corydoras. Corydoras julii are small, peaceful shoaling fish, and are typically kept in groups in captivity.[4] Corydoras julii is a relatively small species of fish, growing to be no more than 52 millimeters in length.[5] Its skin is a translucent whitish-gray, with fine black spotting across the body and a horizontal stripe which reaches up the mid-body until it is equal with the front base of the dorsal fin. This spotting pattern is the primary visual difference between C. julii and three stripe corydoras (C. trilineatus), which have larger reticulations, as opposed to spots, and a longer mid-body stripe. C. julii might be further distinguished from C. trilineatus by the spotted pattern on its head; however, C. trilineatus can also show this pattern on occasion.[5] Females are typically larger and rounder than males.[6] Corydoras julii, like almost all Corydoras species, are bottom-feeding scavengers. Their diet consists primarily of small invertebrates which they sift from the substrate, expelling the particles of sand and sediment through their gill openings. In captivity, their diet is frequently sinking pellets rich in insect and other invertebrate proteins, as well as live or frozen invertebrates like bloodworms, daphnia, brine shrimp, and California blackworms (Lumbriculus variegatus).[4] After sexual maturity, Corydoras spawning appears to be triggered by storms.[6] During this storm, the fish eat increased amounts of insects. The water gradually decreases temperature over the course of a few days.[6] Corydoras fish breed in a position resembling a \"T formation\". In this formation, the female swims up to the male's abdomen, and consumes sperm released by the male. The sperm rapidly travels though the female's intestinal tract and fertilizes the eggs in the cloaca. Small, white, sturdy eggs are laid on plant leaves in the wild. Adult corydoras have been known to eat their own eggs.[6]"

It was originally described as Silurus callichthys by Linnaeus in 1758.[1] It is likely to represent a species complex.[2] C. callichthys is distributed in all major river drainages of South America.[2] It is very wide-ranging, extending from Trinidad to  Buenos Aires, Argentina, including the upper Amazon River and Paraguay River systems. The fish will grow in length up to eight inches (20 centimeters).  The females are larger and more robust, and are a dull olive-green, while the males are brighter in color, exhibiting a delicate blue or violet sheen laterally, with a more developed and longer pectoral fin spine that is reddish-brown and edged with orange or reddish-orange. It lives in a variety of water types, from anoxic conditions (slack water zones surrounded by dense vegetation) to slightly turbid, but free-flowing, streams.[1] It can be found in waters with pH range of 5.8 to 8.3, a water hardness of 0\u201330dGH, and a temperature range of 64\u201383\u00a0\u00b0F (18\u201328\u00a0\u00b0C).[1] When its biotype becomes dry, it can move out of the water, due to its ability to swallow air and use its intestines to absorb oxygen from the atmosphere, to find more water.[1] It feeds at night on fish, insects, and plant matter.  Juveniles feed on rotifers, in addition to the microcrustaceans and aquatic insect larvae they find when digging into the substrate.[1] During reproduction, the male's belly turns orange and its pectoral spines become longer and thicker.  The male builds a bubble nest with some floating plants, fiercely guarding it after the female lays down her eggs.[1] The cascarudo is of commercial importance in the aquarium trade industry and of minor importance as a food source.[1] It can be kept in aquariums, with groups of more than five individuals recommended.[1]"

        "description": " Megalechis thoracata (black marble hoplo, spotted hoplo[1]) is a species of catfish of the family Callichthyidae.  M. thoracata is found east of the Andes in the Amazon, Orinoco, and upper Paraguay River basins, as well as in the coastal rivers of the Guianas and northern Brazil. Recent introductions were recorded in the upper Paran\u00e1 River drainage.[2] Overview: The Spotted Hoplo Catfish is an incredibly hardy and relatively easy species to keep in captivity, with the main difficulty being the maximum size of around 6 inches, or 15\u00a0cm.They are a very peaceful fish, with the only exception being when the males are guarding a bubble nest at breeding time. They can be kept with almost all tankmates, but they will likely eat anything that can fit in their mouths due to their opportunistic nature. This rule also applies for larger fish, as the Hoplo may get eaten or have its barbels or fins damaged by large, potentially aggressive fish, such as South American Cichlids, African Cichlids, larger catfish and most larger fish species that can fit the Hoplo in its mouth or shows aggression. Tank Setup: They require a soft sand substrate, as they are bottom dwellers that can often be observed foraging/searching for food. A gentle substrate is essential, as other coarse grained or abrasive substrates can irritate the fish's sensitive barbels, and even cause them to fall off. To thrive in the aquarium, they need a minimum tank size of 55 US liquid gallons, but as a rule of thumb for this fish, the larger the tank, the better.[3][4] They are semi-social creatures that prefer to be kept in groups of at least five, but still seem content alone or in pairs. The spotted hoplo catfish needs hiding places, usually in the form of rocks, wood and plants, such as variations of Anubias, valisineria, java fern and micranthemum. Floating plants are also appreciated, as they provide extra cover. Water Conditions: Despite the Hoplo being a very hardy fish, like all fish they need a mature, cycled tank with the correct parameters for almost all tropical species. As they are a species of tropical fish, the optimal temperature for them is around 24\u201328 degrees Celsius, but they can adapt to temperatures in the 22\u201330 degrees Celsius range, although this is not recommended and over a long period of time this can lead to elevated stress levels, amongst other health concerns. The natural habitat of Megalechis thoracata is slow flowing, low oxygen parts of the  Amazon, Orinoco, and upper Paraguay River basins. For this reason, catfish of the family Callichthyidae among other fish, have developed a unique way of breathing, where the fish will rise to the surface of the water and ingest a small amount of air.[5] The oxygen is then absorbed through the lining of the stomach and intestine. This is known as gastrointestinal respiration. They will feed on small to medium-sized worms and other invertebrates, small fish, and general detritus. M. thoracata has been observed to produce sounds during territorial behavior in males at their nest sites and especially during spawning, and during aggressive behavior in both sexes. M. thoracata males aggressively defend territories against intruders.[6]"

        "description": " The emerald catfish  (Corydoras splendens) is a tropical freshwater fish belonging to the Corydoradinae sub-family of the family Callichthyidae native to the Amazon Basin in South America.[1] It has traditionally been known as Brochis splendens.[2] The fish has appeared on a stamp in Brazil.[3] It was originally described as Callichthys splendens by Fran\u00e7ois Louis de la Porte, comte de Castelnau in 1855.  This species was once also commonly called Brochis coeruleus. W. A. Gosline was the first to suspect that the two species were the same in 1940, but it was actually Njiseen & Isbr\u00fccker, in 1970, who combined the two, giving sufficient reasons for doing so. The species would be described as Brochis splendens, until most of the catfish formerly classified as Brochis were re-classified into Corydoras.[2] The current recognized classification is thus Corydoras splendens.[1] It is native to the upper reaches Amazon Basin.[1] This includes Ucayali River to Pucallpa, Ambiyacu River, and the area around Iquitos in western Brazil, southeastern Colombia, eastern Ecuador and eastern Peru. Depending upon the angle of lighting, the fish's body reflects a metallic green, blue-green, or even a bluish color.  The ventral area is yellowish with the pectoral, ventral, and anal fins yellowish and the dorsal, caudal, and adipose fins a translucent brownish.  The females are larger and more robust than the males, and have a more pinkish belly as opposed to the more yellowish one for the males. This fish can be distinguished from the green/bronze corydoras catfish by its usually larger size, stouter body, and more pointed snout. The fish inhabits sluggish waters with dense vegetation along the banks.[1] It occurs in shallow muddy waters and will grow in length up to 7.5\u00a0centimetres (3\u00a0in).[1] It lives in a tropical climate in water with a 5.8\u20138.0 pH, a water hardness of 2\u201330 dGH, and a temperature range of 22\u201328\u00a0\u00b0C (72\u201382\u00a0\u00b0F).[1] It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, and insect larvae. It lays eggs in dense vegetation and adults do not guard the eggs. The emerald catfish is a common species in freshwater aquaria.  It is a peaceful, undemanding species and can be maintained under the same conditions as most Corydoras species.  They are shy and easily frightened when kept as individuals, so it is best kept in small groups of at least three, with more being recommended.  The tank should have only a soft, fine bottom to prevent damage to barbels and should be heavily planted.[4] Feeding is not difficult and they accept almost anything, although live worms are especially appreciated.[5] It does well in a community tank and does not tear up the plants.[5] Spawning has been achieved in captivity.[4] Typically, the fish are separated into a breeding tank in the ratio of three males to two females, all well-conditioned on live foods.  The couple will spawn while sitting on the bottom, not while swimming as many similar species do. In captivity, the female collects the eggs in her pelvic fin basket and pastes them individually to plants and other objects.  Eggs will be deposited by the female throughout the tank, but especially on any floating surface plants.  According to most reports, the parents do not immediately try to eat the eggs.  The eggs hatch in about four days and the fry become free swimming two days later."

It is native to South America, and is found in the western Amazon basin in Ecuador and Peru. This species is traditionally placed in Brochis but the genus is a synonym of Corydoras.[1][2] FishBase continues to recognize Brochis as a valid genus.[3] The fish has about 17 dorsal fin rays as compared with the 11 or 12 commonly seen in Corydoras splendens. The snout is considerably longer than other species in the genus which explains the common name. The fish will grow in length up to 6.7 centimetres (2.6 inches).[citation needed] The hog-nosed catfish lives in a tropical climate in water with a 6.0\u20137.2 pH, a water hardness of 15 dGH, and a temperature range of 21\u201324\u00a0\u00b0C (70\u201375\u00a0\u00b0F).

It originates in coastal drainages in South America from Rio de Janeiro to Santa Catarina, Brazil.[2] It was originally described as Callichthys barbatus by Jean Ren\u00e9 Constant Quoy & Joseph Paul Gaimard in 1824, from which it was transferred to genus Corydoras as Corydoras barbatus, a name which by which it is still being referred to in the aquarium industry. The species was further transferred to genus Scleromystax in 2003.[3] The fish will grow in length up to 9.8\u00a0centimetres (3.9\u00a0in).[2] This species has pronounced sexual dimorphism. The dorsal and pectoral fins of males reach, or almost reach, the caudal peduncle, and well-developed odontodes are inserted in fleshy tissue on a large area on the sides of the snout in fully grown males.[4] The banded corydoras lives in a subtropical climate in water with a 6.0\u20138.0 pH, a water hardness of 2\u201325 dGH, and a temperature of 68\u00a0\u00b0F (20\u00a0\u00b0C) to 82\u00a0\u00b0F (28\u00a0\u00b0C).[2] It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. It lays eggs in dense vegetation and adults do not guard the eggs. In captivity, as the sperm are released the female sinks to the bottom, resting on one of her pectoral fins while she starts fanning with the other pectoral fin. At this time, some eggs are released which fall into the pelvic fin basket and are apparently fertilized at that time. The banded corydoras is of commercial importance in the aquarium trade industry. Though peaceful, they get larger than most Corydoras and are therefore less suitable for small aquaria.[5]  This Callichthyidae-related article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it."

It originates in inland waters in South America, and is found in the coastal rivers of French Guiana, Guyana, and Suriname. The specific epithet melanistius means black sail, referring to the dorsal fin. The fish will grow in length up to 5.1 centimetres (2.0 inches). It lives in a tropical climate in water with pH 6.0 - 8.0, a water hardness of 2 \u2013 25 dGH, and a temperature range of 22\u201326\u00a0\u00b0C (72\u201379\u00a0\u00b0F). It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. It lays eggs in dense vegetation and adults do not guard the eggs. The female holds 2\u20134 eggs between her pelvic fins, where the male fertilizes them for about 30 seconds. Only then does the female swim to a suitable spot, where she attaches the very sticky eggs. The pair repeats this process until about 100 eggs have been fertilized and attached. The bluespotted corydoras is of commercial importance in the aquarium trade industry.  This Callichthyidae-related article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it."

        "description": " The bronze corydoras  (Corydoras aeneus), also known as the green corydoras, bronze catfish, lightspot corydoras or wavy catfish, is a species of freshwater fish in the armored catfish family, Callichthyidae, often kept as an aquarium fish. It is widely distributed in South America on the eastern side of the Andes, from Colombia and Trinidad to the R\u00edo de la Plata basin;[2] however, as presently defined it is a species complex and a taxonomic review is necessary.[3] It was originally described as Hoplosoma aeneum (based on a specimen from Trinidad) by Theodore Gill in 1858 and has historically also been referred to as Callichthys aeneus.[2] The adult size is 6\u00bd cm for males and a slightly larger 7\u00a0cm for females (2\u00bd to 2\u00be inches).[4]   Females have a slightly higher body frame than males in accordance with their larger abdominal region. Their average life span is 10 years. It has a yellow or pink body, white belly, and is blue-grey over its head and back. Its fins are yellow or pink and immaculate. In common with most Corydoras the dorsal, pectoral and adipose fins have an additional sharp barb and have a mild poison which causes fish which try to attack them to get stung. A brownish-orange patch is usually present on the head, just before the dorsal fin, and is its most distinctive feature when viewed from above in the stream. Their upper sides are often a greenish color, which is the reason another common name for this fish is the green corydoras. Like many other catfishes, females are larger than males in this species.[5] They are found in quiet, shallow waters with soft bottoms that can sometimes be heavily polluted by clouds of disturbed mud from the bottom, but it also inhabits running waters.[2] In its native habitat, it inhabits waters with a temperature range of 25\u00a0\u00b0C to 28\u00a0\u00b0C (77\u00a0\u00b0F to 82\u00a0\u00b0F), pH 6.0\u20138.0, and hardness 5 to 19 DGH.[2] Like most members of the genus Corydoras, these catfish have a unique method of coping with the low oxygen content that prevails in such environments. In addition to utilizing their gills like any other fish, they rapidly come to the surface of the water and draw air in through their mouth. This air is then absorbed through the wall of the intestine and any surplus air is expelled through the vent.[2] It typically stays in schools of 20 to 30 individuals.[2] It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter.[2] Reproduction occurs with the onset of the rainy season, which changes the water chemistry.[2] Females spawn 10\u201320 egg-clutches with multiple males at a time, but an entire egg clutch is inseminated by the sperm of a single male.[5] In laboratory observations, it was found that bronze corydoras have a unique method of insemination. When these fish reproduce, the male will present his abdomen to the female. The female will attach her mouth to the male's genital opening, creating the well-known \"T-position\" many Corydoras exhibit during courtship. The female will then drink the sperm. The sperm rapidly moves through her intestines and is discharged together with her eggs into a pouch formed by her pelvic fins. The female can then swim away and deposit the pouch somewhere else alone. Because the T-position is exhibited in other species than just C. aeneus, it is likely that they also exhibit this behavior.[6] In the wild, eggs are laid on waterweeds.[5] Males do not form territories or compete over females; interference between males might only happen when two males present their abdomens simultaneously. On the other hand, females do not choose between males. Mating is more or less random; therefore, male reproductive success is directly related to courtship frequency.[5] The eggs of C. aeneus exhibit a unique surface pattern with small villi-like protuberances which resemble attaching-filaments of teleost eggs. These structures allow the eggs to be adhesive and stick to a specific place or to each other. The presence of these structures may be related to the turbid habitat in which this species lives.[7] Bronze corydoras are probably the most popular Corydoras species.[8] It is annually bred and shipped in large quantities all over the world[9] It is easily bred and is produced in commercial quantities in the United States, Europe, and Singapore. Most of the available fish are therefore domestic strains. Wild imports are reported to be less easy to breed.[citation needed] They are a hardy and useful aquarium fish despite having a coloration that is by no means striking or unusual. Many aquarists are fascinated by the habits of these fish. They ceaselessly comb the bottom of the aquarium for food and therefore disturb it slightly, sending up detritus and waste material that has settled loosely on the bottom. They prefer being kept in groups of 5 or more, being sociable fish and are ideal fish for a community tank.[2] Other Corydoras species can be placed in the same aquarium, and despite the strong resemblance many species bear to one another, the species will tend to separate out and only move about among their own kind. Corydoras aeneus is not particular about the composition of the water. Adequate conditions are a temperature range of 20 to 28\u00a0\u00b0C (68 to 82\u00a0\u00b0F), pH of 6.0\u20138.0, and hardness of 2\u201330 DGH. The water should have no salt added to it.[8] A fairly dense growth of plants with a number of possible hiding places is greatly appreciated. Corys are easy to feed, they are omnivores eating all flake and pelleted food and also live and frozen foods. When it comes to sperm, then the female glues the eggs, only a few in number, to the chosen substrate and then (sometimes) quickly touches them with her mouth. After several acts of spawning, which span a total of two to three hours, one female will have produced up to 200 eggs. Frequently, two males are used for each female, as one male has difficulty fertilizing all the eggs. The eggs gradually grow darker in color, and just prior to hatching (ranging from three days at 28\u00a0\u00b0C to a week at 20\u00a0\u00b0C) they turn dark brown. The fry keep to the bottom of the tank, feeding on detritus and any fine foods available. The parents may spawn again within two to three weeks. The albino corydoras is an albino variety of the bronze corydoras that has been developed for the aquarium trade, with a pale pink or orange body and red eyes.  It is physically similar to normally-colored individuals, although some breeders report that the fry are a little slower to develop.[10] Others say that the albinos are practically blind and that the males are somewhat sterile, although this may be due to extensive inbreeding.[11] Albino bronze corydoras are frequently injected with bright dye (via a needle) and sold in aquariums. This controversial practice is known as \"painting\" or \"juicing\" fish."

        "description": " The dwarf corydoras (Corydoras hastatus), dwarf catfish, tail spot pygmy catfish, or micro catfish is a tropical freshwater fish belonging to the subfamily Corydoradinae of the family Callichthyidae.  It originates in inland waters in South America, and is found in the Amazon River and Paraguay River basins in Argentina, Bolivia, and Brazil.[1] The specific epithet hastatus means with a spear, in reference to the spearhead-like spot on the tail root. The body of Corydoras hastatus is typically more elongated than other Corydoras species.  Its body is a translucent white to olive color, with a thin dark stripe on the sides from behind the gill cover to the root of the tail, and a whitish belly.  It has a white crescent at the base of the tail surrounding a black spot.  The fish will grow in length up to 1.4 inches (3.5\u00a0cm), but 1.0 inch (2.5\u00a0cm) is more typical.  Males are smaller, more slender and have a more pointed dorsal fin than females. The dwarf corydoras lives in a (sub)tropical climate in water with a 6.0\u20138.0 pH, a water hardness of 5\u201319 dGH, and a temperature range of 68\u201382 F (20\u201328\u00a0\u00b0C).[1] It is found in ponds.[1] It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. They are found in the Paraguay River and Amazon River basins. C. hastatus lives among plants.[1] It is a schooling species.[1] It differs from most Corydoras species by preferring the midwater areas instead of the bottom, spending most of its time well off the bottom in areas of dense plants.  When it rests, it rests on the leaves of the plants.  Other Corydoras species with similar mid-water habits include C. habrosus and C. pygmaeus. The dwarf Corydoras maintains its position in a current by using rapid fin movements, especially with its pectoral fins. These rapid movements, combined with a high breathing rate, give the fish the appearance of being very \"nervous\" when compared with other fish. C. hastatus may even shoal with small characins. The fish lays its eggs in dense vegetation and the adults do not guard the eggs.  The female holds a single egg between her pelvic fins, where the male fertilizes them for about 30 seconds.  Only then does the female swim to a suitable spot, where she attaches the sticky egg. The pair repeats this process about every three minutes for from one to two hours with some 10- to 15-minute rests between egg releases.  Around 7 to 15 eggs are spawned in a single day, and spawning occurs on three to four consecutive days. A total of 30 to 60 eggs may be spawned by a single female over this period of time. The eggs hatch in three to nine days.  The fry are about 6\u00a0mm long at hatching, mostly translucent but sometimes with spots. In two months, the fry average about 18\u00a0mm in length.  The fry mature in six to eight months. The dwarf corydoras is of commercial importance in the aquarium trade industry.   Due to its small size, this fish can be kept in a relatively small aquarium; a 5-gallon (20 litre) tank is sufficient for a small school.  Since it is a schooling fish, it should only be kept in groups of at least six individuals.  It is a good community tank fish when kept with peaceful tankmates such as tetras, rasboras, and danios, but should not be kept with overly aggressive tankmates.  They have also been used as scavengers for fry tanks. The aquarium should be clean, well-aerated, and densely planted to provide hiding places.  A moderate current provided by a power filter or canister filter is appreciated.  The water should be slightly alkaline (pH about 7.6) within a temperature range of 24\u00b0 to 29\u00a0\u00b0C.  Although the fish is generally a mid-water dweller, a fine gravel or sand substrate should be provided since it will occasionally burrow. The fish will feed both in midwater or on a substrate, whether that substrate is a plant leaf, a broad rock, or the bottom of the tank.  It accepts most foods, including freeze-dried, flake, and frozen foods, although live foods are particularly appreciated. The methods of spawning this fish in the aquarium is similar to spawning most other Corydoras species.  The spawning tank can be as small as 2.5 gallons (10 L), but at least a 5-gallon (20 L) tank is recommended with aged water, a sponge filter and some plants.  Fish should be conditioned with large amounts of live foods such as Tubifex and whiteworms, during which time the females will become noticeably plumper.  Since C. hastatus may spawn as a school, the whole group can be conditioned for spawning at the same time, and for best results, there should be at least two males for every female. Spawning of well-conditioned fish may be initiated by the addition of cooler water.  During spawning, very little food is accepted, but the fish will immediately search for food after finishing.  It will typically attach its eggs to the plants in the aquarium, but if not enough plants are available, the sides of the aquarium may be used.  When the fry hatch, they can be fed newly hatched brine shrimp or microworms.  The parents may be ready to spawn again in a couple of weeks."

The fish's appearance is characterized by dark double longitudinal stripes. The dorsal fin is ornamented by a few gray dots, taking on an arching pattern in some individuals. The body has other gray and black markings on an olive background. Compared with other species of Corydoras, the body is not as tall in comparison to its length, and its eyes are set a bit lower. The fish will grow in length up to 5.1 centimetres (2.0 inches). It lives in a tropical climate in water with a 6.0 - 8.0 pH, a water hardness of 2 \u2013 25 dGH, and a temperature range of 22\u201326\u00a0\u00b0C (72\u201379\u00a0\u00b0F). It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. Though it lays eggs in dense vegetation, adults do not guard them. In captivity, the male is reportedly territorial during the prespawning activities while the female is usually hidden among the plant roots. Both sexes clean the underside of plant leaves. Eggs are fastened under the leaves and are also attached to roots of plants. The elegant corydoras is of commercial importance in the aquarium trade industry. It tends to swim in the upper levels of the aquarium, instead of at the bottom as is common with most species of Corydoras, and does not seem to disturb the sediment as much."

The female holds 2\u20134 eggs between her pelvic fins, where the male fertilizes them for about 30 seconds.  Only then does the female swim to a suitable spot, where she attaches the very sticky eggs. The pair repeats this process until about 100 eggs have been fertilized and attached. The reticulated corydoras is of commercial importance in the aquarium trade industry.  This Callichthyidae-related article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it."

        "description": " Corydoras panda is a species of catfish belonging to the genus Corydoras, of the family Callichthyidae, and is a native member of the riverine fauna of South America.  It is found in Peru and Ecuador, most notably in the Hu\u00e1nuco region, where it inhabits the R\u00edo Aquas, the R\u00edo Amarillae, a tributary of the R\u00edo Pachitea, and the R\u00edo Ucayali river system. The species was first collected by Randolph H. Richards in 1968, and was named Corydoras panda by Nijssen and Isbr\u00fccker in 1971. The specific name is an allusion to the appearance of the fish, which possesses large black patches surrounding the eyes, reminiscent of those found on the giant panda. Accordingly, the common names for this fish, which is a popular aquarium species, are panda corydoras and panda catfish. Corydoras panda has an off-white to pinkish-orange ground colour, and when observed under certain lighting conditions, a faint greenish iridescence is present upon the flanks and the operculum. The fins of the fish match the body in ground colour, upon close inspection being seen to be hyaline or translucent with coloured fin rays, with the dorsal fin being marked by a conspicuous black blotch that covers almost the entire fin area. The caudal peduncle is marked with a black band, this black band encircling the caudal peduncle from dorsal to ventral surface. The adipose fin, supported by a small fin spine, sometimes contains black pigmentation. The head is the same ground colour as the body, with a black mask surrounding the eyes, descending vertically from the fontanel, over each eye, and ending in a triangular wedge immediately before the ventral surface of the head. The pectoral fins are positioned immediately behind the operculum, and are usually oriented horizontally when the fish is at rest, extended in a manner similar to the wings of an aeroplane. The pelvic fins are positioned upon the ventral surface of the fish, located some way behind the pectoral fins. The first ray of the dorsal fin emanates from the body at approximately its point of greatest elevation, and a vertical line drawn downwards from this point meets the attachment point of the pelvic fins. The anal fin is located far to the rear of the ventral surface of the body, the attachment point of the first fin ray being somewhat forward of the black caudal peduncle marking described above. In common with all other members of the family Callichthyidae, the body surface is covered, not with scales, but with bony plates known as scutes. The lines of demarcation between individual scutes can be seen upon close examination of this and almost all other Callichthyid fishes, and in the case of some specimens of this species, are highlighted by additional black pigment. The fish possesses, in common with almost all Corydoras species, three pairs of barbels\u2014one pair of maxillary barbels and two pairs of rictal barbels. A fully mature adult specimen of this species attains a standard length of 55 millimetres (2.1\u00a0inches): this is the length attained by mature females, which grow larger than mature males, and also possess more rounded body outlines. Corydoras panda inhabits clear river waters that are relatively fast-flowing, well-oxygenated, and flowing over substrates that may comprise soft sand or fine gravel. These rivers are usually well vegetated with assorted species of aquatic plants. The proximity of the home rivers of the fish to the Andes mountain range, and the replenishment of those rivers with meltwaters from Andean snows at higher altitudes, has led the fish to be adaptable to cooler temperatures than the norm for 'tropical' fishes\u2014the temperature range of the fish is 16\u00a0\u00b0C to 28\u00a0\u00b0C, though the fish exhibits a marked preference for the cooler regions of this temperature spectrum, particularly in captivity. Indeed, the fish can, for small time-periods, survive temperatures as low as 12\u00a0\u00b0C, though captive rearing at such low temperatures is ill-advised. The native waters of Corydoras panda are consequently mineral-deficient, with a neutral to slightly acid pH, and replication of such conditions in captivity are recommended for successful maintenance. Corydoras panda has a preference for cooler than normal waters when compared to many other popular tropical fish species. Because of this, those who keep C. panda in community aquarium setting must choose tankmates that share its preference for cooler temperatures of around 20\u00a0\u00b0C (68\u00a0\u00b0F) to 25\u00a0\u00b0C (77\u00a0\u00b0F).[2] Given the cleanliness of the fish's native waters, scrupulous attention to water quality in the aquarium is considerably more important for this fish than for the more domesticated Corydoras species such as C. paleatus or C. aeneus. Additionally, scrupulous attention to aquarium substrate cleanliness is a must, as the fish are intolerant of poor aquarium maintenance in this area, and succumb to stress and disease rapidly if their aquaria are not kept to a high standard. Despite this, the species remains highly popular with aquarists, upon account of the appearance of the fish, and its lively, vivacious behaviour in a well-planned aquarium setting. Like many other Corydoras species, the panda catfish is a highly gregarious fish, and in common with several other smaller Corydoras species such as C. habrosus and C. pygmaeus, manifests a distinct need for numerous companions of its own species in order to thrive, and can thus be described as being more avowedly social than some of the larger members of the genus. A minimum of eight individuals should be housed in the same aquarium, and if space permits, this number should be revised upwards, as the fish exhibits a very definite preference for grouping together with others of its species. They also associate themselves easily with the clown loach and school together in currents where sufficient numbers of their own species is lacking. An aquarium for this species should be well furnished, ideally with a mixture of live aquatic plants, and solid furnishings providing caves, sheltered areas and hiding places to give the fish security. Floating plants to provide additional areas of shade are also welcomed by the fish. Like all Corydoras species, the fish feeds primarily upon animal matter. The aquarist is advised, however, that the traditional use of Corydoras catfishes as putative 'scavengers' in an aquarium setting will be detrimental to the well-being of this species\u2014it requires high quality foods for long-term maintenance, and a varied diet. Ideally, the fish should be given live foods at least intermittently, and will dine enthusiastically upon such items as Bloodworms (larvae of Chironomus midges), Daphnia, cultivated Brine Shrimp (Atermia salina), and Tubifex worms. The last, however, should be cultivated in order to minimise the risk of introducing pathogenic organisms to the aquarium, as Tubifex live in unsanitary conditions in the wild. Freeze dried Tubifex may be preferable, as the risk of introduction of disease is eliminated. High quality flake foods are also appreciated, particularly those containing shrimp or other similar matter. The lifespan of Corydoras panda in the aquarium has not been systematically determined, but given the longevity of other Corydoras species in the aquarium, it is reasonable to assume that well-cared for specimens will enjoy a lifespan in excess of ten years, and frequently in excess of 15 years. Corydoras panda follows, with a few minor deviations, the standard model for breeding for the genus. Stimulus for breeding consists of the influx of cooler, oxygenated waters into their habitat, usually corresponding in the wild with the onset of the rainy season. However, while some Corydoras species require a temperature drop in the aquarium for spawning to be stimulated, in the case of Corydoras panda, the temperature drop appears to matter much less, as specimens have spawned in the aquarium without a temperature drop. The addition of new, clean, oxygenated water appears to be the primary stimulus for this species. In the wild, the appearance of new water courtesy of the rains is followed by an increase in the populations of assorted food organisms, and feeding upon these conditions the fishes for breeding. Once conditioned fish are stimulated into spawning, males begin chasing females energetically. Females begin developing eggs within their reproductive tracts, and when 'ripe' (laden with eggs), become receptive to the attentions of the males. Eventually, one male will succeed in courting a female, using his barbels to provide stimulation to the female, usually beginning with caresses of the female's caudal peduncle, followed by caresses of the fontanel and the front of the head. if the female is receptive, then the male positions himself before the female, so that the female's mouth is in close proximity with one of the male's pectoral fins. The male then clasps the female's barbels between the pectoral fin and the body, and this stimulates the female to press against the male's side. When seen from above, the fish form a 'T' shape when conjoined thus, hence the term 'T position' has become conventional in aquarium circles when describing the breeding of Corydoras catfishes. Once the male and female are in the 'T position', the pressing of the female against the male's body stimulates his release of sperm. Though the exact mechanism of fertilisation has yet to be scientifically documented, from the observations of aquarists who have been successful in breeding Corydoras catfishes, it seems likely that the female takes the male's sperm through her mouthparts, and directs them through the gills, in a current that carries the sperm to her pelvic fins. At this point, the female releases a single egg (occasionally two), and purses her pelvic fins in order to provide a receptacle for the freshly extruded egg, which is then fertilised. One difference observed between the adoption of the 'T position' in Corydoras panda, when compared to other Corydoras species, is that the exercise is frequently more acrobatic in appearance, with the 'T position' being adopted in mid-water, some distance above the substrate, rather than resting upon the substrate as is the case with the majority of other Corydoras. Once the female is carrying a fertilised egg within her pelvic fins, she then seeks an egg deposition site. The choice of such a site is frequently, though not always, a mass of fine leaved aquatic vegetation. In the aquarium, the plant known as Java moss, Vesicularia dubayana, is of considerable utility as an egg repository for Corydoras catfishes, even though the plant is not a South American native, and panda catfish females will choose large clumps of this plant readily as safe deposition sites for fertilised eggs. The female is frequently pursued by one or more males as she seeks the deposition site, each male presumably seeking to be the chosen mate to fertilise the next egg. Up to 25 eggs may be produced by a single female during a single spawning, which may take place over four to five hours. Fertile Corydoras panda eggs require approximately 3\u20134 days development time before hatching, if kept at a temperature of 22\u00a0\u00b0C. This development time will vary with temperature, taking longer in cooler water. Upon hatching, the fry are four millimetres long, translucent, but already possessing the basic ground colour of the species, and upon close examination, possess fully formed barbels. Even newly hatched fry possess at least some hint of the adult eye patches, and as the fry grow, these patches darken and become more prominent. Even so, at just four millimetres in length, the fry are practically invisible against typical aquarium gravel unless seen to move. The fry take approximately four weeks to develop to the point where the finfold, a continuous undifferentiated membrane resembling that seen at the posterior of a tadpole, has differentiated into the unpaired fins (dorsal, anal and caudal fins). During this time, size will have increased to approximately eight or nine millimetres, and the fish will begin to develop colour changes leading to that of the adult fish. From this point, the caudal peduncle patch and dorsal fin patch will begin to appear, but the body will also be seen to be covered in fine black 'pepper dots' between these black patches. Only after a period of 10 to 12 weeks, at which point the fish has assumed a size of 12 to 14 millimetres, will the fish attain the colouration of the adult, and be in all respects a perfect miniature of the parents. Fry of this species are particularly sensitive to changes in water chemistry and to elevated temperatures. While adult fishes can withstand temperatures of 28\u00a0\u00b0C, fry will die of heat stress if exposed to temperatures above 26\u00a0\u00b0C, and their chances of survival are enhanced if the water temperature is kept at 22\u00a0\u00b0C or below. Water changes made to a nursery aquarium during the first 21 days of life of the fry\u2014the critical period during which they manifest the greatest sensitivity to their environment\u2014must be gradual, and the incoming water conditioned to match that of the existing aquarium water where possible before the water change takes place. While the fry are likely to develop best if given infusoria as part of their feeding r\u00e9gime, it is possible to raise fry to adulthood entirely upon prepared foods."

        "description": " Corydoras paleatus is a species of catfish (order Siluriformes) of the family Callichthyidae. Its common names include blue leopard corydoras, mottled corydoras, and peppered catfish.[1] It originates from the lower Paran\u00e1 River basin and coastal rivers in Uruguay and Brazil.[1] This fish species reach about 5.9 - 7 centimeters (2.3 - 2.75 \u00a0in) SL.[1] The male is smaller than the female, and in proportion to body length, the dorsal fin and pectoral fins are longer on the male than the female.[2] Corydoras paleatus is found in the Amazon basin,[1] and feeds on worms, crustaceans, insects, and plant matter.[1] C. paleatus has been known to produce sound; it does this by the abduction of its pectoral fins. This is used by males during courtship and intrapersonal communication, and by both sexes and juveniles when distressed.[2] In reproduction, males do not behave aggressively toward each other, nor do they monopolize mating areas or females.[2] The T-position is involved in courtship, as with many other Corydoras species.[2] Charles Darwin discovered the C. paleatus when he went to Buenos Aires during his expedition aboard the Beagle during the 1830s.[3] It is a very good choice for the community aquarium, as it is a hardy,[4] good-looking, and peaceful fish.[4] They can be successfully kept with other small, peaceful aquarium fish like livebearers, danios, and tetras. It is sometimes seen in the shops as an albino form, although this is similar to other albino corys (see the C. aeneus albino form). It grows to around 7.5\u00a0cm and is easily bred at home. These fish prefer a planted tank with temperatures around 16 to 24 \u00b0C (61 \u2013 75 \u00b0F), although they can take lower temperatures than this as it originates from colder waters.[3] Their high temperature tolerance seems poor, and 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F) is the highest safe temperature. They like to nibble on the algae that grow on floating plants but are not specialized algae-eating catfish. The lighting must not be too bright, and hiding places, such as bogwood, are needed as they like to hide from the light during certain parts of the day. Heavily planted areas should also be provided, where the light is minimized, as they like darker areas due to their bottom-feeding nature. Diet should be sinking pellets, algae wafers, frozen and live food, such as bloodworm or daphnia. They may also occasionally enjoy blanched spinach, which can be attached to plants with a peg or the side of the glass with magnetic clips. They can be seen to dart to the top of the tank: this is because they can use atmospheric oxygen to supplement what their gills extract from the water.[5] They will do this more frequently  when water quality is starting to deteriorate, and so should be watched for this indication. Peppered corydoras reach their sexual maturity and start to show reproductive behaviors once the females reach an average (minimum) size of 5.625 cm (2.214 inches) and once the males reach about 4.875 cm (1.919 inches).[citation needed] The males initiate the courtship ritual, which entails chasing the females around the tank. The female darts away, and the males search for her and find her a few moments later. The males shiver all over the female and may lie down on top of her. When she is ready to spawn, she turns to the male next to her and pounds below his ventral fin. The pair go into the \"T-position\" with the male releasing the sperm into the female's mouth before the sperm fertilizes the eggs[citation needed]. The female cups her ventral fins and lays a few eggs (usually between 4 and 12 eggs[citation needed]) in her fins.  The eggs are about 1.8 mm in diameter[citation needed]. The female now starts cleaning a spot on the glass to put her eggs on. Corydoras are egg depositors and lay their eggs all over the aquarium. Favorite spots include the heater, filters, and the glass, although, occasionally eggs are also laid on plants and driftwood. After depositing a group of eggs closely together, the female rests for a few moments. The males regroup and start chasing each other and then resume chasing the female. The males are so relentless in this pursuit that they try to mate with the female even while she is busy laying her eggs. The spawning lasts more than an hour, and many eggs are laid in different places. On average, about 50 to 150 eggs are laid during a single spawning[citation needed]. The incubation period for the eggs for peppered corydoras was found to be between 96 hours and 113 hours at 24\u00b12\u00b0C, with the average incubation period being about 102 hours (or 4.25 days)[citation needed]. In one study, the average hatching ratio of the eggs was found to be approximately 87%, with the overall egg-laying period lasting between 20 and 35 days[citation needed]. Peppered cories can eat their eggs, but will not eat the living fry.  At first, the fry is small (with a mean length of 7.5246 mm[citation needed]) and is unable to eat, sustaining themselves on the last of their yolk sacs. The fry will begin to eat 1\u20133 days after hatching, and will eat the protozoan organisms in the tank and can be fed powdered food at this stage.  By about one month, the fry will start to become rounder and will begin developing adult coloration, eventually becoming miniature versions of the adults[citation needed]. The juveniles will reach adult size at around 1 year of age, although this varies between individuals and how well they are kept. The age of sexual maturity also varies between individuals, but juveniles will typically begin breeding at around 8\u201312 months of age. However, they can begin as early as 6 months and as late as 18 months of age. From the onset of sexual maturity, it can take the fish up to another year to successfully produce fertile eggs; at first, entire clutches of eggs may be infertile. Albino strains may develop slower and be less fertile due to inbreeding. Media related to Corydoras paleatus at Wikimedia Commons"

        "description": " Corydoras pygmaeus, or the pygmy corydoras or pygmy catfish[1] is a tropical and freshwater fish belonging to the subfamily Corydoradinae of the family Callichthyidae. It originates in tropical inland waters in South America, and is found in the Madeira River basin in Brazil. The first scientific description of the pygmy corydoras was published in 1966 by German biologist and physician Joachim Knaack, in Aquarien und Terrarien-Zeitschrift.[2][3] One specimen was designated the holotype and one additional specimen was collected as a paratype.[2] The scientific name uses the Latin word pygmaeus, meaning dwarf or pygmy.[4] A species of Corydoras with a similar appearance, Corydoras hastatus was described in the 1880s, and many specimens that were described as Corydoras hastatus between the 1920s and 1950s were subsequently found to be misidentified specimens of the pygmy corydoras.[1] In older literature, the pygmy corydoras is frequently mislabeled due to Corydoras hastatus being the only miniature Corydoras species known at the time.[1] The pygmy corydoras is a silver-colored fish, with an unbroken black line that runs horizontally along the center of the sides of the fish from the tip of its snout to its caudal peduncle.[5] It has a second thin black line along the lower part of the side of the body, from behind the ventral fins and continuing into the tail.[5] The top part of the body has a light black or dark gray shading that starts on the top of its snout and ends at the tail.[5] Newly hatched fry have vertical stripes along the sides of their bodies that fade by the end of their first month, when the horizontal stripes of the adult fish begin to appear.[5] The maximum length of the species is about 3.2 centimeters (1.3\u00a0in),[6] but typical adult sizes are 1.9 centimeters (0.75\u00a0in) for males and 2.5 centimeters (1.0\u00a0in) for females.[1] In addition to their larger length, females are also rounder and broader than males, especially when they have eggs.[7] Young fry grow rapidly after hatching, reaching 13 millimeters (0.51\u00a0in) in six to eight weeks.[1] The pygmy corydoras is widely distributed in inland waters in Peru in tributaries of the Nanay River, in Ecuador in tributaries of the Aguarico River, and in western Brazil in tributaries of the Madeira River.[8] The holotype was obtained from Calama, Brazil, along the Madeira River near the mouth of the Ji-Paran\u00e1 River.[6] The pygmy corydoras lives in a tropical climate in water with a 6.0 - 8.0 pH,[9] a water hardness of 2 \u2013 25 dGH,[9] and a temperature range of 22\u201326\u00a0\u00b0C (72\u201379\u00a0\u00b0F).[9] It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. The pygmy corydoras lays approximately 100 eggs at a time.[9] The female holds 2\u20134 eggs at a time in a pouch formed by her pelvic fins while they are fertilized by the male, which takes about 30 seconds.[9] The female swims to a safe location with the fertilized eggs, where she attaches the sticky eggs to a surface, where they will remain.[9] It is a peaceful fish, shoaling fish and can be kept in a community aquarium of smaller fish species such as ember tetras. It can be fed most sinking foods, flakes, frozen food and sinking wafers. It can be kept with small shrimp and snails. In aquariums, they are often kept on fine grained substrate, such as sand. This enables them to dig through the substrate without injury to their barbels, which can often be lost in sharp substrates. They are often kept at a pH of between 6.5 and 7.0. They are schooling fish that are usually kept in groups of at least four and will also behave much more naturally in larger groups (10 or more). Unlike the larger more common Corydoras, they often swim in shoals around the mid water and lower regions of the tank. C. pygmaeus are peaceful fish which will not thrive with aggressive tankmates. They are perhaps best kept in a planted species tank, or with shrimp such as Neocaridina spp. They seem to do best when offered live foods in addition to prepared food items. Appropriate foods include microworms or similar nematodes, as well as Artemia nauplii (newly hatched brine shrimp)."

        "description": " The salt and pepper catfish (Corydoras habrosus) is a tropical freshwater fish belonging to the Corydoradinae sub-family of the family Callichthyidae. It originates in inland waters in South America, and is found in the Upper Orinoco River basin in Venezuela and Colombia. C. habrosus, is often found in periodic wetlands, large floodplains to where other species migrate seasonally. These small corydoras are prone to entrapment in receding waters, and populations can suffer during the dry season.[2] Their natural habitat tends to be abundant in leaf litter and plant life, providing ample cover to allow these fish to roam moderately freely. As a bottom dwelling species C. habrosus tends to stick to the lower regions of the river, however, on occasion corydoras will dart up to the water surface to take in air. They use their intestines as an air breathing organ to absorb oxygen, and expel the remnant air out of the anus.[3] The fish will grow in length up to 1.4 inches (3.5 centimeters). It lives in a tropical climate in water with a 5.5 \u2013 7.5 pH, a water hardness of 2 \u2013 10 dGH, and a temperature of about 77\u00a0\u00b0F (25\u00a0\u00b0C).[4] The diet consists of worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. It is a peaceful fish and can be kept in a community aquarium of smaller fish species such as ember tetras, clown panchax, endler guppies and small species of rasbora.  It should be kept in groups of at least 6 individuals, ideally 10 or more. A shoal should be kept in a tank that is at least 14 gallons in size.[5] Salt and pepper catfish can be fed most small sinking foods including pellets, flake food and preserved baby brine shrimp. Frozen foods such as baby brine shrimp, rotifers and cyclops can also be fed either regularly or exclusively. In captivity, breeding can be difficult to achieve. Some aquarists report that large water changes with relatively cold water can stimulate habrosus in to spawning.[6] Spawning is marked by obvious behaviours; males will swim close to the female, if multiple males are present they will surround the female swimming from side to side quickly. The female holds an egg visibly under her ventral fin ready for fertilising. The female can then be seen to 'massage' the males belly. The female will then choose an appropriate place to deposit her egg, usually on plants near the substrate, particularly on the underside of the leaves but can also be found on the aquarium glass and decor.  Eggs are rarely placed on the top of the leaves or close to the water surface. The spawning male will protect the female from other males attempting to spawn with her.

        "description": " Sterba's corydoras (Corydoras sterbai) is a member of the South American Corydoras genus of freshwater aquarium catfish and one of the most popular species of Corydoras due to its attractive markings. The fish is native to the Guapor\u00e9 River region between Bolivia and Brazil.[1] Sterba's cory is distinguishable from other Corydoras species as it has white spots on a black background on its head. It is occasionally confused with Corydoras haraldschultzi; the difference is that the latter has a pattern of black dots on a white background on the head.  C. sterbai has recently become available in an albino form and a black form. Like many Corydoras species, Sterba's corydoras is a shoaling catfish, and thus should ideally be kept in groups of 5 or more. In the wild it can be found in Brazil and thus, wild caught fish prefer soft, acidic water. However, Sterba's corydoras is a hardy fish and tank bred specimens have adapted to a wider range of water conditions. However, like almost all fish it will not tolerate high levels of nitrates. Unlike some other catfish they are not good algae eaters, but are good at \"cleaning up\" leftover food and detritus from the substrate. Corydoras sterbai are relatively small for catfish, growing to a maximum size of only 2\u20132.6 inches (5.1\u20136.6\u00a0cm). In captivity Corydoras sterbai readily accepts a wide variety of prepared and frozen foods. Flake food is a good staple diet (which will only be consumed once it has fallen to the bottom) as are sinking pellets or wafers. They relish live and frozen foods such as bloodworm, daphnia and mosquito larvae, but ideally should only be fed such foods once a week due to the high amount of protein in them. It is often problematic to feed Corydoras in aquaria with fast feeding mid-water fish such as tetras as flake and sinking pellets are consumed by such fish before they have hit the bottom and sometimes, even while lying on the substrate. However, this problem can be overcome by placing pellets and flake on the aquarium substrate in caves or under bogwood, or other such areas which are not regularly frequented by mid-water fish. The compatibility of C. sterbai is one of their main selling points as with all other Corydoras species as they are very peaceful catfish and can be kept with other peaceful fish. They should not be kept with overly aggressive bottom dwellers, particularly if there is competition over substrate space as there would be in small tanks or tanks with a large amount of \"furniture\". Ideal companions would be similar sized tetras or particularly, dwarf cichlids. Ideally Corydoras sterbai should be housed with a fine substrate such as sand or gravel in order to avoid doing damage to their delicate barbels. However, large gravel will suffice as long as it is not sharp edged. Their only other requirement is that shade be provided for them, by means of overhanging rock, large leaved plants, arching bogwood or caves. Breeding is not too difficult. A tank with dimensions 18\u2033 x 12\u2033 x 12\u2033 (10 US Gallon) is recommended. The breeding ratio that should be kept is 2 males per female. Good diet together with repeated water changes and drops of temperature are usually sufficient. However, raising the fry is not easy due to its high sensitivity. Occasionally problems can arise while transporting these fish as they are capable of secreting a chemical toxin when stressed or overcrowded. For this reason they are never shipped with other fish. The species name of this Corydoras is in honour of Professor Dr. G\u00fcnther Sterba, professor emeritus of zoology of Leipzig University, member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.[2] Professor Sterba is a professional ichthyologist who nevertheless produced several very popular books regarded as virtual bibles for fishkeepers over the 1970s and 1980s, translated into English under the titles Freshwater Fishes of the World, Aquarium Care and (with Dick Mills) The Aquarists' Encyclopedia, despite his degree of isolation at that time by virtue of living in the then German Democratic Republic."

It is often confused with Corydoras trilineatus,[3] the three stripe corydoras. Corydoras julii are small, peaceful shoaling fish, and are typically kept in groups in captivity.[4] Corydoras julii is a relatively small species of fish, growing to be no more than 52 millimeters in length.[5] Its skin is a translucent whitish-gray, with fine black spotting across the body and a horizontal stripe which reaches up the mid-body until it is equal with the front base of the dorsal fin. This spotting pattern is the primary visual difference between C. julii and three stripe corydoras (C. trilineatus), which have larger reticulations, as opposed to spots, and a longer mid-body stripe. C. julii might be further distinguished from C. trilineatus by the spotted pattern on its head; however, C. trilineatus can also show this pattern on occasion.[5] Females are typically larger and rounder than males.[6] Corydoras julii, like almost all Corydoras species, are bottom-feeding scavengers. Their diet consists primarily of small invertebrates which they sift from the substrate, expelling the particles of sand and sediment through their gill openings. In captivity, their diet is frequently sinking pellets rich in insect and other invertebrate proteins, as well as live or frozen invertebrates like bloodworms, daphnia, brine shrimp, and California blackworms (Lumbriculus variegatus).[4] After sexual maturity, Corydoras spawning appears to be triggered by storms.[6] During this storm, the fish eat increased amounts of insects. The water gradually decreases temperature over the course of a few days.[6] Corydoras fish breed in a position resembling a \"T formation\". In this formation, the female swims up to the male's abdomen, and consumes sperm released by the male. The sperm rapidly travels though the female's intestinal tract and fertilizes the eggs in the cloaca. Small, white, sturdy eggs are laid on plant leaves in the wild. Adult corydoras have been known to eat their own eggs.[6]"

It was originally described as Silurus callichthys by Linnaeus in 1758.[1] It is likely to represent a species complex.[2] C. callichthys is distributed in all major river drainages of South America.[2] It is very wide-ranging, extending from Trinidad to  Buenos Aires, Argentina, including the upper Amazon River and Paraguay River systems. The fish will grow in length up to eight inches (20 centimeters).  The females are larger and more robust, and are a dull olive-green, while the males are brighter in color, exhibiting a delicate blue or violet sheen laterally, with a more developed and longer pectoral fin spine that is reddish-brown and edged with orange or reddish-orange. It lives in a variety of water types, from anoxic conditions (slack water zones surrounded by dense vegetation) to slightly turbid, but free-flowing, streams.[1] It can be found in waters with pH range of 5.8 to 8.3, a water hardness of 0\u201330dGH, and a temperature range of 64\u201383\u00a0\u00b0F (18\u201328\u00a0\u00b0C).[1] When its biotype becomes dry, it can move out of the water, due to its ability to swallow air and use its intestines to absorb oxygen from the atmosphere, to find more water.[1] It feeds at night on fish, insects, and plant matter.  Juveniles feed on rotifers, in addition to the microcrustaceans and aquatic insect larvae they find when digging into the substrate.[1] During reproduction, the male's belly turns orange and its pectoral spines become longer and thicker.  The male builds a bubble nest with some floating plants, fiercely guarding it after the female lays down her eggs.[1] The cascarudo is of commercial importance in the aquarium trade industry and of minor importance as a food source.[1] It can be kept in aquariums, with groups of more than five individuals recommended.[1]"

Recent introductions were recorded in the upper Paran\u00e1 River drainage.[2] Overview: The Spotted Hoplo Catfish is an incredibly hardy and relatively easy species to keep in captivity, with the main difficulty being the maximum size of around 6 inches, or 15\u00a0cm.They are a very peaceful fish, with the only exception being when the males are guarding a bubble nest at breeding time. They can be kept with almost all tankmates, but they will likely eat anything that can fit in their mouths due to their opportunistic nature. This rule also applies for larger fish, as the Hoplo may get eaten or have its barbels or fins damaged by large, potentially aggressive fish, such as South American Cichlids, African Cichlids, larger catfish and most larger fish species that can fit the Hoplo in its mouth or shows aggression. Tank Setup: They require a soft sand substrate, as they are bottom dwellers that can often be observed foraging/searching for food. A gentle substrate is essential, as other coarse grained or abrasive substrates can irritate the fish's sensitive barbels, and even cause them to fall off. To thrive in the aquarium, they need a minimum tank size of 55 US liquid gallons, but as a rule of thumb for this fish, the larger the tank, the better.[3][4] They are semi-social creatures that prefer to be kept in groups of at least five, but still seem content alone or in pairs. The spotted hoplo catfish needs hiding places, usually in the form of rocks, wood and plants, such as variations of Anubias, valisineria, java fern and micranthemum. Floating plants are also appreciated, as they provide extra cover. Water Conditions: Despite the Hoplo being a very hardy fish, like all fish they need a mature, cycled tank with the correct parameters for almost all tropical species. As they are a species of tropical fish, the optimal temperature for them is around 24\u201328 degrees Celsius, but they can adapt to temperatures in the 22\u201330 degrees Celsius range, although this is not recommended and over a long period of time this can lead to elevated stress levels, amongst other health concerns. The natural habitat of Megalechis thoracata is slow flowing, low oxygen parts of the  Amazon, Orinoco, and upper Paraguay River basins. For this reason, catfish of the family Callichthyidae among other fish, have developed a unique way of breathing, where the fish will rise to the surface of the water and ingest a small amount of air.[5] The oxygen is then absorbed through the lining of the stomach and intestine. This is known as gastrointestinal respiration. They will feed on small to medium-sized worms and other invertebrates, small fish, and general detritus. M. thoracata has been observed to produce sounds during territorial behavior in males at their nest sites and especially during spawning, and during aggressive behavior in both sexes. M. thoracata males aggressively defend territories against intruders.[6]"
