In captivity, they are easy to feed with flake, pelleted, live, and frozen foods. They exhibit unique mating behavior, with females spawning 10-20 egg-clutches with multiple males. The species is not particular about water composition, but appreciates a dense plant growth for hiding. They are hardy and useful aquarium fish, constantly combing the bottom for food. The bronze corydoras is easily bred in captivity and is produced in commercial quantities worldwide."

In captivity, they prefer cooler temperatures ranging from 20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C and water conditions similar to their natural habitat, which includes neutral to slightly acidic pH levels. \n\nIn a fish tank, Corydoras panda should be kept in groups of at least eight individuals, as they are highly social and thrive when surrounded by their own kind. The aquarium should be well-furnished with live plants, caves, and hiding spots to provide security for the fish. Water quality and substrate cleanliness are crucial for their well-being, as they are sensitive to poor maintenance and can succumb to stress and disease quickly. \n\nFeeding primarily on animal matter, Corydoras panda requires a high-quality and varied diet that includes live foods like bloodworms, daphnia, and brine shrimp, as well as high-quality flake foods containing shrimp. They can live for over ten years with proper care. Breeding in captivity is possible with the addition of clean, oxygenated water as a stimulus. Females lay eggs on fine-leaved aquatic vegetation, with up to 25 eggs produced in a single spawning. Fry are sensitive to water chemistry and temperature changes, requiring careful attention during their development."

        "description": "Pterygoplichthys gibbiceps, also known as leopard sailfin catfish, is a large armored catfish species native to South America. In an aquarium, they are peaceful towards other fish but may have territorial disputes with other plecos and similar-sized fish. They prefer well-aerated water and a large tank with good filtration due to their potential size of up to 2 feet. They are primarily herbivorous but will also consume dead animals. Their diet can include vegetables, meat, and prepared foods like sinking algae wafers. They are active at night and tend to hide during the day. Breeding involves females laying eggs in caves or hollows, with a high mortality rate until the spawn are around two inches long. They have a mild camouflage ability and can adjust their scales' coloration."

In captivity, they require a minimum tank size of 30 gallons with water temperature between 79\u201388\u00a0\u00b0F and pH levels of 6.5-7.0. They are predators needing a high protein diet of small invertebrates. These fish are nocturnal, territorial, and prefer plenty of hiding spots in a tank that mimics their natural environment with caves, rocks, and a highly oxygenated, fast-moving current. They should not be kept in community tanks and thrive with small dither fish that do not compete for food. The species is commercially bred for the aquarium trade due to restrictions on wild collection. Breeding involves the male guarding the eggs until they hatch, with the fry absorbing their yolk sac in two weeks. The zebra pleco is regulated under CITES Appendix II to control international trade."

They are peaceful and prefer to be kept in schools, so a group of at least six individuals is recommended to reduce stress. Providing them with a varied diet of small live or frozen foods will help them thrive. It is important to maintain stable water parameters and keep tank mates that are not aggressive to ensure the well-being of Espe's pencilfish."

        "description": "The Malawi eyebiter, Dimidiochromis compressiceps, is a predatory cichlid native to Lake Malawi in East Africa. It can grow up to 23 centimeters in length and has a narrow, laterally compressed body with a large mouth. While once believed to feed on the eyes of other fish, this behavior has not been observed in the wild. In an aquarium, they prefer open swimming spaces and can be aggressive during spawning. It is recommended to keep a single male with multiple females to reduce aggression. A tank of at least 100 gallons is necessary due to their size and behavior. They should be kept with larger, less assertive fish and avoid similarly colored species. Like all Lake Malawi cichlids, they thrive in hard, alkaline water conditions."

        "description": "The Neolamprologus multifasciatus, also known as \"multies,\" is a small shell-dwelling cichlid species native to Lake Tanganyika. They are one of the smallest cichlids globally, with males reaching 5 cm and females 2.5 cm in length. In the wild, they form large colonies in Neothauma shell beds. These fish exhibit unique behaviors related to their affinity for shells, such as burrowing sand, seeking refuge, and breeding in shells. They have a pale white color with black vertical bars along their bodies. In an aquarium, they require a sandy substrate for burrowing and shells for shelter. Each fish should have at least one shell, ideally two. They are suitable for smaller tanks and are prolific breeders, making them readily available in fish stores. Neolamprologus multifasciatus is sexually monomorphic, making it challenging to differentiate sexes based on appearance. Stores often sell similar species like N. similis and N. brevis as \"shellbreeders\" or \"shell dwellers.\""

Water parameters should mimic Lake Tanganyika's conditions with a pH of 8.0-8.3, kH of 12-14, and a temperature of 23-27\u00b0C. They are omnivorous and should be fed a varied diet including flakes, pellets, frozen foods, and live brine shrimp. Avoid high protein diets and overfeeding. Tankmates should be peaceful species from their natural biotope like Julidochromis, Cyprichromis, and Synodontis. Breeding is possible, with males spawning with multiple females near their shells. Fry can be fed baby brine shrimp."

        "description": "Anomalochromis thomasi, also known as the African butterfly cichlid, is a small cichlid species found in Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea. It thrives in slightly acidic, oxygen-rich water with other West African cichlid genera in forest streams shaded by dense vegetation. These fish prefer water stained with tannins from decaying organic matter, resembling tea. In a fish tank, they would require a setup mimicking their natural habitat with plenty of vegetation, hiding spots, and subdued lighting. A temperature of around 30\u00b0C (86\u00b0F) would be ideal. A. thomasi are pair-forming and territorial, with the female selecting a laying site on a leaf or flat rock. They exhibit parental care, with the female mainly caring for the brood. The fry are moved to multiple depressions in the substrate by the parents until they become free-swimming. Overall, to thrive in a fish tank, African butterfly cichlids need a well-maintained environment that replicates their natural habitat conditions."

This species thrives in soft, near-neutral, and warm waters. Bolivian rams are omnivorous bottom-feeders that sift through the substrate for food. They are biparental, open-spawning cichlids that exhibit courtship behaviors before laying eggs on a chosen surface. The fry are cared for by both parents and become free-swimming after seven days. Bolivian rams are relatively shy and should be kept in a tank with hiding places like dense plants or bogwood. They prefer a tank environment that mimics their natural habitat with soft, acidic water. These dwarf cichlids can be kept in smaller aquariums with a minimum volume of 80 liters. They are not picky eaters and readily accept various commercially available fish foods."

Rainbow sharks are bottom and mid-level dwellers that feed on algae and plankton. They are picky eaters but primarily consume algae in the form of flakes and also eat live foods like insect larvae and aquatic insects. Rainbow sharks can be housed with barbs, rainbowfish, danios, loaches, plecos, rasboras, and gouramis but should be kept away from smaller, more timid fish as they may become aggressive and territorial. Providing hiding places and decor like plants or caves can help minimize aggressive behavior. Breeding rainbow sharks in an aquarium setting is challenging due to their aggressive nature towards their own kind and other fish."

It is the largest member of the tiger botia group and can grow up to 25-30 cm long. This species is aggressive and should be kept in groups of five or more to spread aggression and establish a natural hierarchy. It is not suitable for community aquariums. Banded loaches prefer water with a pH below 7.0, soft and slightly acidic hardness, and temperatures between 77-86\u00b0F. They thrive in environments with 10-12 bars on the body without blue borders and irregular dark markings on the lower body. Breeding has not been observed in captivity, suggesting it may be a seasonal spawner in the wild."

        "description": "The sailfin molly is a livebearer fish found in freshwater and brackish water habitats along the East Coast of the United States and the Gulf of Mexico. In a fish tank, sailfin mollies thrive in brackish water conditions with a mix of oceanic minerals and freshwater sources. They prefer coastal marshes, mangrove swamps, estuaries, and tidal areas. Sailfin mollies are euryhaline, tolerating salinities up to 87 ppt and breeding in brackish waters. They are small, with males displaying enlarged dorsal fins, and females being larger and plainly colored. Sailfin mollies primarily feed on algae and plant materials, occasionally consuming aquatic invertebrates. They reproduce internally, giving birth to live young in broods of 10-140 after a gestation period of 3-4 weeks. Sailfin mollies are of interest to aquarists for their color variations and are valued as feeder fish. In a tank, they should be provided with ample vegetation, hiding spots, and a mix of salt and freshwater to mimic their natural habitat."

It is popular among killifish enthusiasts and can grow up to 6 cm in length. These fish prefer to stay at the bottom of the water, feeding on zooplankton and small organisms. They are found in flat plains or water depressions that dry up annually and lay their eggs in mud to preserve them until the water returns. Bluefin nothos mature in about twelve weeks and live for up to a year or year and a half, dying at the end of the breeding season. In an aquarium, they can be housed in a 40\u201360 litre tank and are best kept in a community tank with similar-sized peaceful freshwater tropical fish. Males can be aggressive towards other males of the same species. It is important to provide a suitable environment that mimics their natural habitat to ensure their well-being and reproduction."

        "description": "The moonlight gourami is a peaceful and popular aquarium fish known for its silvery color with a greenish hue resembling moonlight. This species thrives in a tank with plenty of aquatic vegetation and shallow, sluggish water. They have a special lung-like organ that allows them to breathe air, making them adaptable to low oxygen situations. Moonlight gouramis are oviparous and use bubble nests for reproduction, with the male carefully preparing the nest and engaging in a courtship dance with the female before spawning. They feed on insects, crustaceans, and zooplankton. To keep moonlight gouramis healthy and happy in a fish tank, it is important to provide a well-planted environment with space for them to swim and explore, as well as ensuring good water quality and proper filtration."

        "description": "The snakeskin gourami is a large gourami species native to Southeast Asia, commonly found in rice paddies, shallow ponds, and swamps with abundant aquatic vegetation. In a fish tank, they are peaceful and suitable for community tanks with other peaceful species like barbs, tetras, and angelfish. They are bottom and middle dwellers, requiring a tank of at least 36 inches in length. The ideal water conditions include a pH of 5.8 to 8.5, water hardness of 2 to 30 dH, and a temperature of 72 to 86\u00b0F. They are omnivores and will eat a variety of foods including live food, flakes, pellets, and vegetables. Breeding them is relatively easy, and they can produce a large number of fry. The males are nonaggressive, and the parents do not eat their fry. Fry can be raised with progressively larger flake foods and occasional live foods like brine shrimp. During breeding, they exhibit territorial behavior and may vocalize sounds."

It is a small fish that reaches a length of about 4 centimeters and displays red, green, and blue hues. This species is known for its ability to produce a croaking noise using a specialized pectoral mechanism. In an aquarium, pygmy gouramis thrive in a heavily planted tank with subdued lighting and no strong currents. They require space between the water surface and tank cover to gulp moist air. These fish prefer a temperature of 25\u00b0C or above and a pH below 7. While they are not schooling fish, they can be kept peacefully in small groups. Pygmy gouramis are hardy and tolerant of less-than-ideal water conditions but do not compete well with aggressive tank mates. They feed on zooplankton and aquatic insects and readily accept flake, live, or frozen foods. Breeding can be induced by adjusting temperature and water level, with the male guarding the eggs in a bubble nest until they hatch. Clean water and proper feeding are crucial for the health of these fish."

        "description": "The reedfish, also known as ropefish or snakefish, is a unique species native to West and Central Africa. It has the ability to breathe atmospheric air, making it suitable for oxygen-poor waters. In a fish tank, reedfish require slow-moving or standing fresh or brackish water with dense plant growth. They are nocturnal and feed on worms, crustaceans, insects, snails, and small fish. Reedfish are inquisitive and peaceful but may be bullied by other fish. They have a tendency to explore land and can be sensitive to water conditions, such as pH swings and nitrogen chemistry. Reedfish are challenging to keep in captivity as they are known to jump out of tanks and are sensitive to water parameters. They are best kept in a species-specific tank to prevent conflicts with other fish and require a secure lid to prevent escape."

In an aquarium, it requires acidic water, low light, and live prey to thrive. This species closely resembles a dead leaf in appearance, with a flattened body and a filament at the tip of its lower jaw. Highly predatory, it feeds on small invertebrates and fish, with larger individuals mainly preying on fish. The Amazon leaffish uses its camouflage to both evade larger predators and ambush smaller prey by swimming slowly in a head-down position, resembling a floating leaf. During breeding, the female lays up to 300 eggs on the underside of a rock or plant leaf, which are fertilized by the male who then cares for the eggs until they hatch. The young are predators from birth, starting with tiny animals like brine shrimp and water fleas."

        "description": "Xenentodon cancila, also known as the freshwater garfish, is a needlefish species found in South and Southeast Asia. In an aquarium setting, they are known to be predators but primarily feed on crustaceans. They are oviparous and spawn in the morning, with the fry needing small live foods to thrive. This species is challenging to maintain due to its large size, nervous behavior, and preference for live foods. Despite misconceptions about their diet and water conditions, they thrive well in freshwater tanks without the need for salt. To ensure their well-being, provide a spacious tank with plenty of plants for egg deposition and hiding spots, and offer a varied diet of live foods to mimic their natural habitat."

It thrives best in brackish to saltwater environments. In captivity, it can grow up to 10 cm in length and is known for its aggressive nature, making it unsuitable for tank mates. This omnivorous species prefers a pH level of 8 and transitions from brackish to saltwater as it matures. It feeds on snails, mollusks, crustaceans, and some plant material. The green spotted pufferfish has a unique genome and is used as a model organism in genetics research. Its striking green body with black spots makes it a popular choice for aquariums, but caution is advised as its flesh contains a toxic substance. To thrive in a fish tank, this species requires a brackish to saltwater environment with appropriate hiding spots and a varied diet to mimic its natural habitat."

        "description": "The rainbow darter is a small freshwater fish native to North America, commonly found in clean, fast-moving streams and rivers. It grows to 2-3 inches in length and is sensitive to pollution and silt. In a fish tank, rainbow darters would thrive in a setup mimicking their natural habitat, with rocky substrates and swift-moving water. They are insectivorous, feeding on small invertebrates, and prefer creeks with rocky substrates for shelter and feeding. Rainbow darters mate during the spring in areas with water temperatures around 17-18\u00b0C. They exhibit territorial behavior during breeding and spawn in groups. To ensure their well-being, it is crucial to maintain water quality and reduce pollution in their environment."

        "description": "The splendid darter, a freshwater fish endemic to the Barren River system in Kentucky and Tennessee, thrives in small rocky pools in creeks and rivers. In a fish tank, it would require a setup mimicking its natural habitat with plenty of rocks and flowing water. This species exhibits specialized reproductive behaviors that rely on specific environmental conditions, making it vulnerable to changes. It is likely insectivorous and may be preyed upon by larger fish. Breeding occurs once a year from March to June, with males establishing territories in deep pools for mating. With an average lifespan of three years, this species is considered rare and faces threats like habitat destruction and invasive species. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect the splendid darter and its unique ecosystem in the southeastern United States."
