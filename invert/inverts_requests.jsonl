[ 3 ] It is commonly found in rivers and streams in coastal areas or on islands. [ 4 ] C. typus is known to play a role in sediment distribution and shredding leaf litter, manipulating the environment using their pereiopods and setaceous chelae. [ 5 ] The species is also an important component of the food web, both as scavengers and as prey items, and is considered a keystone species for the stream ecosystems it inhabits. [ 6 ] According to Choy and Marshall, the species can be characterized by a \"short, dorsally unarmed rostrum, the presence of epipods on the first four pairs of pereiopods, and the presence of an appendix interna on the endopod of the first pleopod of both sexes.\" [ 7 ] It can be kept in captivity by aquarists as pets.\n\nPlease summarize this description into a concise summary that touches on key details such as appearance, habitat, and care requirements.

It lives in shallow-water marshes , ponds , and swamps , feeding on microorganisms and organic material. The maximum length of a specimen is 10\u00a0cm (3.9\u00a0in). Worms raised in laboratory environment are slightly shorter, with 4 to 6\u00a0cm (1.6 to 2.4\u00a0in) long bodies. An adult individual has approximately 150 to 250 1.5\u00a0mm wide segments, [ 1 ] each of which has the ability to regenerate into a new individual when separated from the rest of the animal. In most populations, this is the primary mode of reproduction, and mature individuals are exceedingly rare; in large areas (including Asia, most of North America and the greater part of Europe) mature individuals have never been found.\nThe name blackworm is given to at least three distinct species of worm that are identical in appearance and were once considered a single species.

Tubifex likely includes several species, but distinguishing between them is difficult because the reproductive organs , commonly used in species identification, are resorbed after mating, and because the external characteristics of the worm vary with changes in salinity . These worms ingest sediments, selectively digest bacteria , and absorb molecules through their body walls. \nMicro-plastic ingestion by Tubifex worms acts as a significant risk for trophic transfer and biomagnification of microplastics up the aquatic food chain. [ 1 ] The worms can survive with little oxygen by waving hemoglobin -rich tail ends to exploit all available oxygen, and can exchange carbon dioxide and oxygen through their thin skins, in a manner similar to frogs. They can also survive in areas heavily polluted with organic matter that almost no other species can endure. By forming a protective cyst and lowering its metabolic rate , T. tubifex can survive drought and food shortage. Encystment may also function in the dispersal of the worm.\nThey usually inhabit the bottom sediments of lakes , rivers , and occasionally sewer lines and outlets.
